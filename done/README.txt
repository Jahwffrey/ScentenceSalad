HOW TO USE:
1. Place the text from source one into either text1.txt or text2.txt
2. Place the text from source two into either text2.txt or text1.txt
3. Run the program
4. The results will can be found in outputFile.txt

IMPORTANT NOTE:
-If neither text files have and periods, question marks, or exclamation points it will not work correctly.
-It is best to have the sources be of approximately equal length. If this is not true one will usually dominate over the other.
	-If they are not similar lengths, repeating one of the sources multiple times in one text file works.
-If you wish to run the program on a single text file, simply leave text1 or text2 blank.
-If you wish to mash up more than two, simply copy the contents of the additional text file(s) into one of the existing ones after the text already there.
-As long as there are two .txt files named "text1" and "text2", the program should run.



The included text files are the full text of The book of Genesis and the transcripts of 6 Star Trek TOS episodes.
