(Enterprise is at Red Alert as she orbits a muddy looking planet. Every so often the ship shakes.) 
KIRK: Stay on top of it, Mister Sulu. 
SULU: We're holding orbit, sir. The helm is sluggish. 
SCOTT: Control circuits threatening to overload, Captain. 
KIRK: Understood, Engineer. Mister Spock? We can't avoid these areas of turbulence. 
SPOCK: I believe we'll have them plotted in a few more orbits, Captain. 
(Sulu's console explodes and he is thrown to the floor, unconscious.) 
KIRK: Sickbay. To the Bridge. 
SCOTT: Switching to manual, Captain. Do we maintain this orbit? 
KIRK: Spock? 
SPOCK: This is of great scientific importance, Captain. We're actually passing through ripples in time. 
KIRK: Maintain orbit. Open the channel to Starfleet Command. Precautionary measure, Lieutenant. Broadcast to Starfleet Command my past week's log entries, starting with the unusual readings we had on the instruments and how they led us here. Inform Starfleet Command that apparently something or someone down on this planet 
(McCoy enters) 
KIRK: (pointing to Sulu) Bones. Can effect changes in time, causing turbulent waves of space displacement. 
MCCOY: Some heart flutter. Better risk a few drops of cordrazine. 
KIRK: Tricky stuff. Are you sure you want to risk 
(The hypo is administered and Sulu opens his eyes.) 
MCCOY: You were about to make a medical comment, Jim? 
KIRK: Who, me, Doctor? 
SCOTT: (at the helm) We're guiding around most of the time ripples now. 
KIRK: Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: All plotted but one, Captain. Coming up on it now. Seems to be fairly heavy displacement. 
(And they hit it just as McCoy still has the hypo in his hand, and the jolt results in him injecting it into his own stomach.) 
KIRK: Bones! Get back to your positions. 
SPOCK: The hypo, Captain. 
KIRK: It was set for cordrazine. 
SPOCK: Empty. 
KIRK: Communications, emergency medical team. 
MCCOY: (screams) Killers! Assassins! I won't let you! I'll kill you first! I won't let you! You won't get me! Murderers! Killers! 
(He dashes into the turbolift.) 
KIRK: Security alert.

Captain's log, supplemental entry. Two drops of cordrazine can save a man's life. A hundred times that amount has just accidentally been pumped into Doctor McCoy's body. In a strange, wild frenzy, he has fled the ship's Bridge. All connecting decks have been placed on alert. We have no way of knowing if the madness is permanent or temporary, or in what direction it will drive McCoy.

[Transporter room]

(McCoy enters, knocks out the Chief very quickly and scientifically, then beams himself away.)

[Bridge]

KIRK: Continue alert, decks four through eleven. The medical department knows as little as we do. In dosages approaching this, there's some record of wild paranoia. 
SPOCK: Confirmed by the library record tapes, Captain. Subjects failed to recognise acquaintances, became hysterically convinced that they were in mortal danger, and were seeking escape at any cost. Extremely dangerous to himself or to anyone else who might 
GALLOWAY [OC]: Bridge, Security. Alert, alert! 
KIRK: Bridge here. Go ahead.

[Transporter room]

GALLOWAY: Security 054, sir. We just found the transport chief injured.

[Bridge]

CHIEF [OC]: Captain, Doctor McCoy has beamed himself down to the planet. 
SPOCK: And the transporter at that time, Captain, was focused on the centre of the time disturbance. 
KIRK: So whatever's down there, McCoy is in the heart of it. Set up a landing party. Let's go get him. Kirk out.

[Planet surface]

(The landing party is Kirk, Spock, Scott, Uhura and two security guards. Among remains of fluted columns and fragments of Greek-style buildings is an irregular dough-nut shaped object with lights in it.) 
KIRK: These ruins extend to the horizon. Begin recording. 
UHURA: Recording, sir. 
SPOCK: And of considerable age. On the order of ten thousand centuries old. 
KIRK: Detail, fan out. What is this thing, Mister Spock? It seems to be pulsating with power of some kind. Analysis, please. 
SPOCK: Unbelievable, Captain. 
KIRK: That's funny. 
SPOCK: This single object is the source of all the time displacement. 
KIRK: Explain. 
SPOCK: I can't. For this to do what it does is impossible by any science I understand. It is operating even now. Putting out waves and waves of time displacement, which we picked up millions of miles away. 
UHURA: Landing party to Enterprise. No sign of Doctor McCoy. Search progressing. 
(And he pops up from behind a rock after she and her security guard have passed by.) 
SPOCK: Incredible power. It can't be a machine as we understand mechanics. 
KIRK: Then what is it? 
GUARDIAN: (The doughnut pulses bright in time with the words) A question. Since before your sun burned hot in space and before your race was born, I have awaited a question. 
KIRK: What are you? 
GUARDIAN: I am the Guardian of Forever. 
KIRK: Are you machine or being? 
GUARDIAN: I am both and neither. I am my own beginning, my own ending. 
SPOCK: I see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles. 
GUARDIAN: I answer as simply as your level of understanding makes possible. 
SPOCK: A time portal, Captain. A gateway to other times and dimensions, if I'm correct. 
GUARDIAN: As correct as possible for you. Your science knowledge is obviously primitive. 
SPOCK: Really. 
KIRK: Annoyed, Spock? 
GUARDIAN: Behold. A gateway to your own past, if you wish. 
(A camel train passing a pyramid, ancient Rome - images appear inside the doughnut.) 
MCCOY: Killers! Killers! I won't let you get me! I'll kill you first! I won't let you get me! Assassins! Murderers! Killers! 
(Scott and a guard manage to grab McCoy, and Spock neck-pinches him. An army of lancers charge across the doughnut.) 
KIRK: Spock! If that is a doorway back through time, could we somehow take Bones back a day in time, then 
SPOCK: Relive the accident. This time be certain that the hypo accident is avoided. Look at the speed with which the centuries are passing, Captain. To step through on precisely the day we wish
KIRK: Guardian. Can you change the speed at which yesterday passes? 
GUARDIAN: I was made to offer the past in this manner. I cannot change. 
(The US cavalry charges.) 
KIRK: Strangely compelling, isn't it? To step through there and lose oneself in another world. 
SPOCK: I am a fool. My tricorder is capable of recording even at this speed. I've missed taping centuries of living history which no man before has ever 
(But McCoy has woken up, and dashes towards the Guardian.) 
SCOTT: Doctor McCoy! 
KIRK: Bones, no! 
(McCoy leaps through the doughnut and the pictures stop. He's gone.) 
KIRK: Where is he? 
GUARDIAN: He has passed into... what was. 
UHURA: Captain, I've lost contact with the ship. I was talking to them. Suddenly, it went dead. No static, just nothing. 
KIRK: Kirk to Enterprise. Scotty. 
SCOTT: Nothing wrong with the communicator, sir. 
GUARDIAN: Your vessel, your beginning, all that you knew is gone. 
KIRK: McCoy has somehow changed history. 
SCOTT: You mean we're stranded down here? 
SPOCK: With no past, no future. 
UHURA: Captain, I'm frightened. 
KIRK: Earth's not there. At least, not the Earth we know. We're totally alone.

Captain's log, no stardate. For us, time does not exist. McCoy, back somewhere in the past, has effected a change in the course of time. All Earth history has been changed. There is no starship Enterprise. We have only one chance. We have asked the Guardian to show us Earth's history again. Spock and I will go back into time ourselves and attempt to set right what ever it was that McCoy changed.

SPOCK: I was recording images at the time McCoy left. A rather barbaric period in your American history. I believe I can approximate just when to jump. Perhaps within a month of the correct time. A week, if we're fortunate. 
KIRK: Make sure we arrive before McCoy got there. It's vital we stop him before he does whatever it was that changed all history. Guardian, if we are successful 
GUARDIAN: Then you will be returned. It will be as though none of you had gone. 
UHURA: Captain, it seems impossible. Even if you were able to find the right date 
SCOTT: Then even finding McCoy would be a miracle. 
SPOCK: There is no alternative. 
KIRK: Scotty, when you think you've waited long enough. Each of you will have to try it. Even if you fail, at least you'll be alive in some past world somewhere. 
SCOTT: Aye. 
SPOCK: Seconds now, sir. Stand by. 
SCOTT: Good luck, gentlemen. 
UHURA: Happiness at least, sir. 
(First World War images.) 
SPOCK: And now.

[Street]

(They leap through a wall with a poster for boxing at Madison Square Gardens. Welcome to the Depression.) 
KIRK: I've seen old photographs of this period. An economic upheaval had occurred. 
SPOCK: It was called Depression, circa 1930. Quite barbaric. 
(Two women give then curious looks, and Spock hides his ears with his hands.) 
KIRK: We seem to be costumed a little out of step with the time. 
SPOCK: I'm afraid I'm going to be difficult to explain in any case, Captain. 
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock, if we can't disguise you, we'll find some way of explaining you. 
SPOCK: That should prove interesting. 
KIRK: Let's get out of here. 
(They are nearly run down crossing the street.) 
SPOCK: Fascinating. 
DRIVER: Look out, will you? Why don't you watch where you're going? 
(They head into an alley with washing hanging out on the fire escape.) 
SPOCK: Theft, Captain? 
KIRK: Well, we'll steal from the rich and give back to the poor later. I think I'm going to like this century. Simple, easier to manage. We're not going to have any difficulty explaining 
(Then he sees the policeman.) 
POLICEMAN: Well? 
KIRK: You're a police officer. I recognise the traditional accoutrements. 
SPOCK: You were saying you'll have no trouble explaining it. 
KIRK: My friend is obviously Chinese. I see you've noticed the ears. They're actually easy to explain. 
(A crowd is gathering.) 
SPOCK: Perhaps the unfortunate accident I had as a child. 
KIRK: The unfortunate accident he had as a child. He caught his head in a mechanical rice picker. But fortunately, there was an American missionary living close by who was actually a skilled plastic surgeon in civilian life. 
POLICEMAN: All right, all right. Drop those bundles and put your hands on that wall there! Come on! 
KIRK: Oh, how careless of your wife to let you go out that way. 
POLICEMAN: What? Where? 
SPOCK: Oh, yes, it's quite untidy. Here, let me help you. 
(And a quick neck pinch in front of witnesses, then they grab the clothes and run off. With whistles blowing, they duck down the alley beside the 21st Street Mission and down the stairs to the cellar.)

[Cellar]

KIRK: You were actually enjoying my predicament back there. At times, you seem quite human. 
SPOCK: Captain, I hardly believe that insults are within your prerogative as my commanding officer. 
KIRK: Sorry. 
(They get changed into jeans and shirts.) 
KIRK: Time we faced the unpleasant facts. 
SPOCK: First, I believe we have about a week before McCoy arrives, but we can't be certain. 
KIRK: Arrives where? Honolulu, Boise, San Diego? Why not Outer Mongolia, for that matter? 
SPOCK: There is a theory. There could be some logic to the belief that time is fluid, like a river, with currents, eddies, backwash. 
KIRK: And the same currents that swept McCoy to a certain time and place might sweep us there, too. 
SPOCK: Unless that is true, Captain, we have no hope. Frustrating. Locked in here is the place and moment of his arrival, even the images of what he did. If only I could tie this tricorder in with the ship's computers for just a few moments. 
KIRK: Couldn't you build some form of computer aid here? 
SPOCK: In this zinc-plated vacuum-tubed culture? 
KIRK: Yes, well, it would pose an extremely complex problem in logic, Mister Spock. Excuse me. I sometimes expect too much of you. 
(The lights come on.) 
EDITH: Who's there? 
(Spock puts on a woolen hat that was conveniently amongst the clothes Kirk stole. A young woman wearing an apron comes down the stairs.) 
KIRK: Excuse us, miss. We didn't mean to trespass. It's cold outside. 
EDITH: A lie is a poor way to say hello. It isn't that cold. 
KIRK: No. We were being chased by a policeman. 
EDITH: Why? 
KIRK: These clothes. We stole them. We didn't have any money. 
EDITH: Well, I could do with some help around here. Doing dishes, sweeping, general cleaning. 
SPOCK: At what rate of payment? I need radio tubes and so forth. My hobby. 
EDITH: Fifteen cents an hour for ten hours a day. What are your names? 
KIRK: Mine is Jim Kirk. His is Spock. 
EDITH: I'm Edith Keeler. You can start by cleaning up down here. 
KIRK: Excuse me, Miss. Where are we? 
EDITH: You're in the 21st Street Mission. 
KIRK: Do you run this place? 
EDITH: Indeed I do, Mister Kirk. 
(She leaves them.) 
KIRK: Radio tubes and so on. I approve of hobbies, Mister Spock.

[Canteen]

(Kirk and Spock collect their bowls of soup and pieces of bread, and sit at one of the long tables.) 
EDITH: Good evening. 
(She steps up onto a small stage with a piano.) 
MAN: You'll be sorry. 
KIRK: Why? 
MAN: You expect to eat for free or something? You got to listen to Goody Two-shoes. 
EDITH: Now, as I'm sure somebody out there has said, it's time to pay for the soup. 
MAN: Not that she's a bad-looking broad, but if she really wanted to help out a fella in need 
KIRK: Shut up. Shut up. I want to hear what she has to say. 
SPOCK: Yes, of course, Captain. 
EDITH: Now, let's start by getting one thing straight. I'm not a do-gooder. If you're a bum, if you can't break off of the booze or whatever it is that makes you a bad risk, then get out. Now I don't pretend to tell you how to find happiness and love when every day is just a struggle to survive, but I do insist that you do survive because the days and the years ahead are worth living for. One day soon man is going to be able to harness incredible energies, maybe even the atom. Energies that could ultimately hurl us to other worlds in some sort of spaceship. And the men that reach out into space will be able to find ways to feed the hungry millions of the world and to cure their diseases. They will be able to find a way to give each man hope and a common future, and those are the days worth living for. Our deserts will bloom. (She continues under the dialogue.) 
KIRK: Development of atomic power is years away, and space flight years after that. 
SPOCK: Speculation. Gifted insight. 
KIRK: I find her most uncommon, Mister Spock. 
EDITH: Prepare for tomorrow. Get ready. Don't give up. 
(Later, when the bowls are being handed in, Edith calls after Kirk.) 
EDITH: Mister Kirk. You are uncommon workmen. That basement looks like it's been scrubbed and polished. 
KIRK: Then we can report back for other work? 
EDITH: Yes. Seven o'clock in the morning. Do you have a flop for the night? 
KIRK: A what? 
EDITH: You really are new at this, aren't you? A flop is a place to sleep. 
KIRK: Oh. 
EDITH: There's a vacant room at the place where I live for two dollars a week. If you want to I'll take you there. 
KIRK: Thank you. 
EDITH: Good. 
(She goes to get her coat.) 
KIRK: We have a flop. 
SPOCK: We have a what, Captain? 
KIRK: A place to sleep. 
SPOCK: One might have said so in the first place.

[Room]

(It must be some days later, because Spock has already built a 50's horror movie contraption, complete with static electricity running between two vertical wires. Kirk enters with groceries.) 
SPOCK: Captain, I must have some platinum. A small block would be sufficient, five or six pounds. By passing certain circuits through there to be used as a duodynetic field core. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, I've brought you some assorted vegetables, baloney in a hard rolls for myself, and I've spent the other nine tenths of our combined salaries for the last three days on filling this order for you. Mister Spock, this bag doesn't contain platinum, silver or gold, nor is it likely to in the near future. 
SPOCK: Captain, you're asking me to work with equipment which hardly very far ahead of stone knives and bearskins. 
KIRK: McCoy will be along in a few days, perhaps sooner. There's no guarantee that these currents in time will bring us together. This has to work. 
SPOCK: Captain. Captain, in three weeks at this rate, possibly a month, I might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits. 
(There's a knock at the door.) 
KIRK: Your hat. 
EDITH: If you can leave immediately, I can get you five hours work at twenty two cents an hour. What? What on Earth is that? 
SPOCK: I am endeavouring, ma'am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bearskins.

[Canteen]

(Kirk and Spock are sweeping the floor, with the chairs stacked on the tables, and two men repairing clocks.) 
SPOCK: Captain. Tools for finely detailed work. 
(Later, a combination padlock is being opened by someone with very sensitive ears.)

[Cellar]

(Spock is stoking the boiler when Edith comes in to confront them.) 
EDITH: That toolbox was locked with a combination lock and you opened it like a real pro. Why did you do it? 
SPOCK: I needed the fine tools for my radio work. They'd have been returned in the morning. 
EDITH: I'm sorry, I can't 
KIRK: If Mister Spock says that he needs the tools and that they'll be returned tomorrow morning, you can bet your reputation on that, Miss Keeler. 
EDITH: On one condition. Walk me home? I still have a few questions I'd like to ask about you two. Oh, and don't give me that questions about little old us? look. You know as well as I do how out of place you two are around here. 
SPOCK: Interesting. Where would you estimate we belong, Miss Keeler? 
EDITH: You? At his side, as if you've always been there and always will. And you? You belong in another place. I don't know where or how. I'll figure it out eventually. 
SPOCK: I'll finish with the furnace. 
EDITH: Captain. Even when he doesn't say it, he does.

[Street]

(They are strolling along, hand in hand, as 'Goodnight, Sweetheart' carries in the air from a radio repair shop.) 
EDITH: Why does Spock call you Captain? Were you in the war together? 
KIRK: We served together. 
EDITH: And you don't want to talk about it? Why? Did you do something wrong? Are you afraid of something? Whatever it is, let me help. 
KIRK: Let me help. A hundred years or so from now, I believe, a famous novelist will write a classic using that theme. He'll recommend those three words even over I love you. 
EDITH: Centuries from now? Who is he? Where does he come? Where will he come from? 
KIRK: Silly question. Want to hear a silly answer? 
EDITH: Yes. 
KIRK: A planet circling that far left star in Orion's belt. See? 
(Not that you can actually see any stars in the night sky above the Brooklyn Bridge.)

[Room]

(Using the clock-mender's tools, Spock gets an image on his tricorder screen of a newspaper report. Edith Keeler, social worker from 21st Street Mission was killed today, it says. Kirk enters.) 
KIRK: How are the stone knives and bearskins? 
SPOCK: I may have found our focal point in time. 
KIRK: You may also find you have a connection burning someplace. 
SPOCK: Yes. I'm overloading those lines. I believe we'll have our answer on this screen. 
KIRK: Good. 
SPOCK: And, Captain, you may find this a bit distressing. 
KIRK: Let's see what you have. 
SPOCK: I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex. 
KIRK: February 23rd, 1936. Six years from now. (reading below the headline FDR confers with slum area 'angel') The President and Edith Keeler conferred for some time today 
(Then the whole thing goes up in flames.) 
KIRK: How bad? 
SPOCK: Bad enough. 
KIRK: The President and Edith Keeler. 
SPOCK: It would seem unlikely, Jim. A few moments ago, I read a 1930 newspaper article. 
KIRK: We know her future. Within six years from now, she'll become very important. Nationally famous. 
SPOCK: Or Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year. I saw her obituary. Some sort of traffic accident. 
KIRK: You must be mistaken. They both can't be true. 
SPOCK: Captain, Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been looking for, the point that both we and Doctor McCoy have been drawn to. KIRK: She has two possible futures then, and depending on whether she lives or dies, all of history will be changed. And McCoy 
SPOCK: Is the random element. 
KIRK: In his condition, what does he do? Does he kill her? 
SPOCK: Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed. We don't know which. 
KIRK: Get this thing fixed. We must find out before McCoy arrives. 
SPOCK: Captain, suppose we discover that in order to set things straight again, Edith Keeler must die?

[Street]

(The man from the canteen steals a milk bottle from a doorstep when McCoy leaps in through Singers Book Store window and starts shouting.) 
MCCOY: Assassins! Murderers! Murderers! Assassins! You! What planet is this? (he drops the bottle) No! Don't run! I won't kill you! It's they who do the killing! Don't run! I won't kill you!

[Boarding house]

(Jim and Edith are climbing the stairs together.) 
EDITH: Why? What is so funny about man reaching for the moon? 
KIRK: How do you know? 
EDITH: I just know, that's all. I feel it. And more, I think that one day they'll take all the money they spend now on war and death 
KIRK: And make them spend it on life? 
EDITH: Yes. You see the same things that I do. We speak the same language. 
KIRK: The very same. 
(They are outside room 33 when he leans in for the kiss.)

[Street]

(McCoy catches the down-and-out.) 
MAN: No! 
MCCOY: I'm glad you got away, too. Why do you think they want to kill us? 
MAN: Look, fella, you take a sip too much of that old wood alky, and, and almost anything seems like it 
MCCOY: Where? Where are we? Earth? The constellations seem right, but. Explain! Explain this trick. 
MAN: I, I, 
MCCOY: Biped. Small. Good cranial development. No doubt considerable human ancestry. Is that how you're able to fake all of this? Very good. Modern museum perfection. Right down to the cement beams. Very, very good. Oh, I'd give a lot to see the hospital. Probably needles and sutures. All the pain. They used to hand-cut and sew people like garments. Needles and sutures. Oh, the terrible pain! 
(He passes out on the ground and his colour starts to improve. The man frisks him, finds his phaser and runs off a little way. Then he fiddles with the phaser, and disintegrates himself.)

[Room]

KIRK: How long before we get a full answer? 
SPOCK: I'll need at least two more days before I dare make another attempt. 
KIRK: McCoy could have been in the city a week now for all we know, and whatever he does that affects her and changes history could happen tonight or tomorrow morning. 
SPOCK: Captain, our last bit of information was obtained at the expense of thirty hours work in fused and burned circuits. 
KIRK: I must know whether she lives or dies, Spock. I must know what to do.

[Street]

(It's morning, apparently. Bums are still sleeping in shop doorways.) 
CRIER [OC]: Extra! Extra! Get your morning paper! Get your paper. Read all about it! 
(McCoy spots men going into the Mission and follows them.)

[Canteen]

(Edith is pouring cups of brown liquid.) 
MCCOY: Oh, Miss. That coffee, it just smells wonderful. 
EDITH: You look terrible! You'd better sit down. Come on. 
MCCOY: I can't. I got to keep moving. I can't let them find me. 
EDITH: There's a cot in the back room. They won't find you there. Come on. 
(She helps him out just as Spock comes in and starts serving the drinks.

[Room]

SPOCK: This is how history went after McCoy changed it. Here, in the late 1930s. A growing pacifist movement whose influence delayed the United States' entry into the Second World War. While peace negotiations dragged on, Germany had time to complete its heavy-water experiments. 
KIRK: Germany. Fascism. Hitler. They won the Second World War. 
SPOCK: Because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first. There's no mistake, Captain. Let me run it again. Edith Keeler. Founder of the peace movement. 
KIRK: But she was right. Peace was the way. 
SPOCK: She was right, but at the wrong time. With the A-bomb, and with their V2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world. 
KIRK: No. 
SPOCK: And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from dying in a street accident as she was meant to. We must stop him, Jim. 
KIRK: How did she die? What day? 
SPOCK: We can estimate general happenings from these images, but I can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain. I'm sorry. 
KIRK: Spock, I believe I'm in love with Edith Keeler. 
SPOCK: Jim, Edith Keeler must die.

[Mission back room]

(McCoy stirs, dislodging the moist towel from his forehead.) 
EDITH: Hey, now, come on. You're not ready to take on any tigers just yet. Lie down. 
MCCOY: The most common question to ask would be, where am I? I don't think I'll ask it. 
EDITH: Why not? 
MCCOY: The only possible answer would conclusively prove that I'm either unconscious or demented. This looks like old Earth around 1920 or 25. 
EDITH: Would you care to try for 30? 
MCCOY: I am unconscious, or demented. 
EDITH: I have a friend that talks about Earth the same way that you do. Would you like to meet him? 
MCCOY: I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist. I am Leonard McCoy, Senior Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. 
EDITH: I don't mean to disbelieve you, but that's hardly a Navy uniform. 
MCCOY: It's quite all right. It's quite all right dear, because I don't believe in you, either. 
EDITH: Get some rest.

[Boarding house]

(Edith has just gone up a flight of stairs.) 
KIRK: Edith. 
EDITH: Are you following me, sir? 
KIRK: With ulterior motives. Does that please you? 
EDITH: I hope it means (she stumbles on the step and Kirk catches her, while Spock watches.) Oh! How stupid! I've been up and down those stairs a thousand times. I could have broken my neck. 
(Spock goes back into room 21 as she kisses Jim, and re-emerges when Kirk comes down the stairs again.)
SPOCK: Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop. 
KIRK: No, of course you didn't. 
SPOCK: I must point out that when she stumbled, she might have died right there, had you not caught her. 
KIRK: It's not yet time. McCoy isn't here. 
SPOCK: We're not that sure of our facts. Who's to say when the exact time will come? Save her, do as your heart tells you to do, and millions will die who did not die before.

[Mission back room]

(McCoy is out of bed.) 
MCCOY: Come in. 
EDITH: Well, you look just fine, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Thank you. 
EDITH: I thought you might like to see the evening paper. 
MCCOY: No, not particularly. You know, I've convinced myself that this is all in a cordrazine hallucination, but I've decided you're not. 
EDITH: That's reassuring. 
MCCOY: But if you're not, what are you? 
EDITH: A friend. When you showed up here, you looked like you could use one. 
MCCOY: I don't doubt it. What about this place? Do you run it? 
EDITH: I try to. 
MCCOY: Why? 
EDITH: It's necessary. 
MCCOY: Well, it was for me, at least. You may have saved my life. 
EDITH: Lots of people drink from the wrong bottle sometimes. 
MCCOY: Not as wrong as the bottle I drank from. Allow me to show my gratitude. Perhaps there's something I can do around here to thank you. 
EDITH: We can talk about that later. I have to go. My young man is taking me to a Clark Gable movie. 
MCCOY: A who movie? 
EDITH: A Clark Gable. Don't you know? 
MCCOY: Well, I know what a movie is, but. 
EDITH: That's very strange. You get some rest. I'll see you later.

[Street]

(Edith, Kirk and Spock leave the Mission together, then Spock heads off alone. Kirk and Edith dodge traffic to cross the street.) 
EDITH: If we hurry, maybe we can catch the Clark Gable movie at the Orpheum. 
KIRK: What? 
EDITH: You know, Doctor McCoy said the same thing. 
KIRK: McCoy! Leonard McCoy? 
EDITH: Yes. He's in the Mission. He's 
KIRK: Stay right here. Spock! Stay right there! 
SPOCK: What is it? 
KIRK: McCoy! He's in 
(McCoy comes out and they greet each other enthusiastically. A truck is coming down the street as Edith starts to cross, not looking.) 
SPOCK: No, Jim! 
KIRK: Edith. 
(McCoy dashes forward but Kirk grabs him and pulls him back onto the pavement just as Edith and the truck meet in in a squeal of brakes.) 
MCCOY: You deliberately stopped me, Jim. I could have saved her. Do you know what you just did? 
SPOCK: He knows, Doctor. He knows.

[Planet surface]

(Kirk and Spock leap back out of the Guardian.) 
SCOTT: What happened, sir? You only left a moment ago. 
(McCoy returns.) 
SPOCK: We were successful. 
GUARDIAN: Time has resumed its shape. All is as it was before. Many such journeys are possible. Let me be your gateway. 
UHURA: Captain, the Enterprise is up there. They're asking if we want to beam up. 
KIRK: Let's get the hell out of here.

Captain's log, Star date 1312.4. The impossible has happened. From directly ahead, we're picking up a recorded distress signal, the call letters of a vessel which has been missing for over two centuries. Did another Earth ship once probe out of the galaxy as we intend to do? What happened to it out there? Is this some warning they've left behind?
[Briefing room]

SPOCK: Your move, Captain. 
KIRK: We should have intercepted by now. The Bridge said they'd call. 
SPOCK: I'll have you checkmated your next move. 
KIRK: Have I ever mentioned you play a very irritating game of chess, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Irritating? Ah, yes. One of your Earth emotions. 
KIRK: Certain you don't know what irritation is? 
SPOCK: The fact one of my ancestors married a human female 
KIRK: Terrible having bad blood like that. 
KELSO [on monitor] Bridge to briefing lounge. Object is now within tractor beam range. 
KIRK: No visual contact, Mister Kelso? 
KELSO [on monitor]: No, sir. It's too small to be a vessel. It only reads about one metre in diameter. 
SPOCK: Not large enough even for a lifeboat. 
KELSO [on monitor] Small enough to bring it aboard, sir, if you want to risk it. 
KIRK: Lock onto it, Mister Kelso.

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: Materialiser ready, sir. 
KIRK: Bring it aboard. Old-style ship recorder that could be ejected when something threatened the ship. 
SPOCK: More like destroyed the ship in this case. Look at it. Burnt, pitted. 
KIRK: Let's hope its tapes are intact. We'll feed it through Mister Spock's computer. 
SCOTT: Yes, sir. It's begun transmitting, sir. 
KIRK: Flash the Bridge. Put all decks on the alert.

[Turbolift]

MITCHELL: Hold it, Jim. 
KIRK: Getting into shape? 
MITCHELL: Yeah, well I figured you weren't on the Bridge. Kelso's voice sounded a little nervous. Well, uh, you finish the game? 
SPOCK: He played most illogically. His next move should have been the rook.

[Bridge]

MITCHELL: Yore relieved, Mister Alden. 
ALDEN: Acknowledged, Mister Mitchell. 
KIRK: Screen on. 
KELSO: Screen on, sir. Approaching galaxy edge, sir. 
KIRK: Neutralise warp, Mister Mitchell. Hold this position. 
MITCHELL: Neutralise warp, sir. 
KIRK: Address intercraft. 
MITCHELL: Intercraft open. 
KIRK: This is the Captain speaking. The object we encountered is a ship's disaster recorder, apparently ejected from the S.S. Valiant two hundred years ago. 
SPOCK: The tapes are burnt out. Trying the memory banks. 
KIRK: We hope to learn from the recorder what the Valiant was doing here and what destroyed the vessel. We'll move out into our probe as soon as we have those answers. All decks, stand by. 
MITCHELL: Department heads, sir. You wanted everybody on the Bridge before we left the galaxy. Jones. SMITH: The name's Smith, sir. 
SULU: Astro sciences standing by, Captain. 
SCOTT: Engineering division ready, as always. 
PIPER: Life sciences ready, sir. This is Doctor Dehner, who joined the ship at the Aldebaran colony. 
DEHNER: Psychiatry, Captain. My assignment is to study crew reaction in emergency conditions. 
SPOCK: Getting something from the recorder now. 
DEHNER: lf there was an emergency, I'd be interested in how that crew reacted, too. 
MITCHELL: Improving the breed, Doctor? Is that your line? 
DEHNER: I heard that's more your specialty, Commander, line included. 
MITCHELL: (to Kelso) Walking freezer unit. 
SPOCK: Decoding memory banks. I'll try to interpolate. The Valiant had encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this direction. 
KIRK: The old impulse engines weren't strong enough. 
SPOCK: Swept past this point, about a half light year out of the galaxy, they were thrown clear, turned, and headed back into the galaxy here. I'm not getting it all. The tapes are pretty badly burned. Sounds like the ship had encountered some unknown force. Now, orders, counter orders, repeated urgent requests for information from the ship's computer records for anything concerning ESP in human beings. 
KIRK: Extrasensory perception. Doctor Dehner, how are you on ESP? 
DEHNER: In tests I've taken, my ESP rated rather high. 
KIRK: I'm asking what you know about ESP. 
DEHNER: It is a fact that some people can sense future happenings, read the backs of playing cards and so on, but the esper capacity is always quite limited. 
SPOCK: Severe damage. Seven crewmen dead. No, make that six. One crewman seemed to have recovered. That's when they became interested in extrasensory perception. More than interested, almost frantic about it. No, this must be garbled. I get something about destruct. I must have read it wrong. It sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy his own ship. 
KIRK: Comments? 
PIPER: The only fact we have for sure is that the S.S. Valiant was destroyed. 
KIRK: That's probably the best argument to continue the probe. Other vessels will be heading out here someday and they'll have to know what they'll be facing. We're leaving the galaxy, Mister Mitchell. Ahead, warp factor one. 
SPOCK: Force field of some kind. 
MITCHELL: We're coming up on it fast. 
SPOCK: Sensor beam on. 
KELSO: Sensor beam on, sir. 
SPOCK: Deflectors full intensity. 
KELSO: Deflectors full intensity. 
SPOCK: Deflectors say there's something there, sensors say there isn't. Density negative. Radiation negative. Energy negative. 
KELSO: Whatever it is, contact in twelve seconds. 
KIRK: Gravitation on automatic. (consoles blow up) Emergency stations. All decks on fire alert. Neutralise controls. Kelso, put it on manual. Any radiation? Anything? 
SPOCK: Negative! 
KIRK: Helmsmen, take us out of here. (Dehner gets hit by an electric charge, then Mitchell) Helmsmen! (Kirk takes controls) Lateral power! (Spock takes over, Enterprise veers away) Take damage reports. 
SPOCK: Damage control reports, all stations! 
CREWMAN [OC]: Gravity control switching to batteries. 
DEHNER: Something hit me, like an electrical charge. 
PIPER: He's alive. Appears to be in shock. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Engineering deck three, can you give damage report? 
CREWMAN 2 [OC]: Sensor beams. Full power on the deflectors. 
SPOCK: Main engines are out, sir. We're on emergency power cells. Casualties, nine dead. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Gravity is down to point eight. 
CREWMAN 2 [OC]: All decks, this is Bridge Engineering. Due to emergency conditions. 
KIRK: Gary. Gary, are you all right? 
MITCHELL: I'm a little weak for some reason, Jim, but I feel all right now. (opens eyes, they're glowing)

Captain's log, Star date 1312.9. Ship's condition, heading back on impulse power only. Main engines burned out. The ship's space warp ability gone. Earth bases which were only days away are now years in the distance. Our overriding question now is what destroyed the Valiant? They lived through the barrier, just as we have. What happened to them after that?

[Bridge]

DEHNER: Autopsy report, sir. Each case showed damage to the body's neural circuit. An area of the brain was burned out. 
KIRK: And you, are you feeling all right? 
DEHNER: Yes. Mitchell, too, except for his eyes. We're trying to find a reason for that now, and why, out of our whole crew, only certain people were affected. 
SPOCK: I think we've found that answer, Doctor. 
KIRK: You mentioned that tests show you have a high degree of extrasensory perception. So do the records of the others. Gary Mitchell has the highest esper rating of all. 
DEHNER: lf you're suggesting there's anything dangerous 
SPOCK: Before the Valiant was destroyed, its captain was frantically searching for ESP information on his crew. 
DEHNER: Espers are simply people with flashes of insight. 
SPOCK: Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects, cause fires to start spontaneously? 
DEHNER: There's nothing about it that could possibly make a person dangerous. 
SPOCK: Doctor Dehner is speaking of normal ESP power. 
DEHNER: Perhaps you know of another kind? 
KIRK: Do we know for sure, Doctor, that there isn't another kind?

[Sickbay]

MITCHELL: (without looking) Hello, Jim. Hey, you look worried. 
KIRK: I've been worried about you ever since that night on Deneb IV. 
MITCHELL: Yeah, she was nova, that one. Not nearly as many after-effects this time, except for the eyes. They kind of stare back at me when I'm shaving. 
KIRK: Do you feel any different? 
MITCHELL: In a way, I feel better than I've ever felt before in my life. It actually seems to have done me some good. 
KIRK: How? 
MITCHELL: Well, I'm getting a chance to read some of that longhair stuff you like. Hey man, I remember you back at the academy. A stack of books with legs. The first thing I ever heard from upperclassmen was, Watch out for Lieutenant Kirk. In his class, you either think or sink. 
KIRK: I wasn't that bad, was I? 
MITCHELL: If I hadn't aimed that little blonde lab technician at you 
KIRK: You what? You planned that? 
MITCHELL: Well, you wanted me to think, didn't you? I outlined her whole campaign for her. 
KIRK: I almost married her! 
MITCHELL: You better be good to me. I'm getting even better ideas here. 
KIRK: You? Spinoza? 
MITCHELL: Once you get into him, he's rather simple though. Childish, almost. I don't agree with him at all. 
KIRK: Go on. 
MITCHELL: I'm trying to tell you I feel fine. When do I go back on duty? 
KIRK: I'm going to ask Doctor Dehner to keep you under observation for a while. 
MITCHELL: With almost a hundred women onboard, you can do better than that, friend Captain. 
KIRK: Consider it a challenge. 
MITCHELL: That doesn't seem very friendly. Didn't I say you'd better be good to me?

[Bridge]

SPOCK: He's reading even faster now than just a few moments ago. Is that Gary Mitchell, the one you used to know? 
KIRK: Put a twenty four hour watch on the Sickbay. Fullest possible range of examinations and tests.

[Sickbay]

PIPER: Perfect, perfect. I've never had a patient like you, Gary. Even the healthiest are generally off on some reading. leaves) 
DEHNER: I know you don't particularly like me, Mister Mitchell, but since I am assigned here, can we make the best of it? 
MITCHELL: I've got nothing against you, Doctor. 
DEHNER: Nor against the walking freezer unit? 
MITCHELL: Well, I, sorry about that. 
DEHNER: Women professionals do tend to overcompensate. Now let's talk about you. How do you feel? 
MITCHELL: You know, everybody, everybody seems worried that I don't have some kind of fever or something. Maybe if we could just change these dials (sends them soaring). Now back to normal, I think. 
DEHNER: How did you do that? 
MITCHELL: I'm not sure, I, I just thought of making it happen, and it does. It's, hey, er hey watch this, Doc. 
(indicators plummet, Mitchell collapses) 
DEHNER: Stop it. Stop it! You were dead for almost twenty two seconds. There were no readings at all. 
MITCHELL: Yeah. Oh, boy. You, you know, Doc, there have been other things too, like going halfway through the ship's library in hardly a day. Yeah. Oh, what's happening to me? 
DEHNER: Do you remember everything you read that quickly? 
MITCHELL: Yeah. 
DEHNER: On any tape? 
MITCHELL: Sure. Yeah. 
DEHNER: Try this one. 
MITCHELL: Yeah. 
DEHNER: Page three eighty seven. 
MITCHELL: My love has wings. Slender, feathered things with grace in upswept curve and tapered tip. The Nightingale Woman, written by Phineas Tarbolde on the Canopius planet back in 1996. It's funny you picked that one, Doctor. 
DEHNER: Why? 
MITCHELL: That's one of the most passionate love sonnets of the past couple of centuries. How do you feel, Doctor? 
DEHNER: What? 
MITCHELL: How do you feel? 
DEHNER: I just fell. Nothing happened. 
MITCHELL No? Are you sure? Are you sure? 
KELSO: Er, I was on my coffee break. I thought I'd check up on 
MITCHELL Yeah, that's okay Lee, come on in. Don't let the light in my eyes bother you, pal. It's all for our, our good-looking lady doctor here. 
KELSO: Yeah. Sure. 
MITCHELL: So, er, so, how go the repairs? 
KELSO: Well, the main engines are gone, unless we can find some way to re-energise them. 
MITCHELL: You'd better check the starboard impulse packs. Those points have about decayed to lead. 
KELSO: Oh, yeah, sure, Mitch. 
MITCHELL: I'm not joking, Lee! You activate those packs, and you'll blow the whole impulse deck. 
KELSO: I'll, er, I'll get on it right away. I just wanted to stop by and make sure you were okay. See you later. (leaves) 
MITCHELL: He's a fool. A fool. He'd seen those points and he hadn't noticed their condition. 
DEHNER: How do you know? 
MITCHELL: The image of what he'd seen was still in his mind.

[Briefing room]

KELSO: Well, it didn't make any sense that he'd know, but naturally, I checked out the circuit anyway. I don't know how, but he was right. This point is burned out exactly the way he described it. 
DEHNER: Sorry I'm late. I became so interested in observing Gary, Mister Mitchell. 
SPOCK: Our subject is not Gary Mitchell. Our concern is, rather, what he is mutating into. 
DEHNER: I know those from your planet aren't suppose to have feelings like we do, Mister Spock, but to talk that way about a man you've worked next to for years is worse than 
KIRK: That's enough, Doctor. 
DEHNER: I don't think so. I understand you least of all. Gary told me that you've been friends since he joined the service, that you asked for him aboard your first command. 
KIRK: It is my duty, whether pleasant or unpleasant, to listen to the reports, observations, even speculations, on any subject that might affect the safety of this vessel, and it's my science officer's duty to see I'm provided with that. Go ahead, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Have you noted evidence of unusual powers? 
DEHNER: He can control certain autonomic reflexes. He reads very fast, retains more than most of us might consider usual. 
KIRK: Mister Scott, would you repeat what you just told us? 
SCOTT: About an hour ago, the Bridge controls started going crazy. Levers shifting by themselves, buttons being pushed, instrument readings changing. 
SPOCK: And on my monitor screen I could see Mitchell smiling each time it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his amusement. 
KIRK: Are they right, Doctor? Has he shown abilities of such magnitude? 
DEHNER: I saw some such indications. 
KIRK: And you didn't think it worth mentioning? 
DEHNER: No one's been hurt, have they? Don't you understand? A mutated superior man could also be a wonderful thing. The forerunner of a new and better kind of human being. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu. 
SULU: If you want the mathematics of this, Mitchell's ability is increasing geometrically. That is, like having a penny, doubling it every day. In a month, you'll be a millionaire. 
SPOCK: In less time than that, he will have attained powers we can't understand and can't cope with. Soon we'll be not only useless to him, but actually an annoyance. 
KIRK: There'll be no discussion of this with the crew. Thank you. (everyone else leaves)
SPOCK: We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard, Jim. You heard the mathematics of it. In a month he'll have as much in common with us as we'd have with a ship full of white mice. 
KIRK: I need a recommendation, Spock, not vague warnings. 
SPOCK: Recommendation one. There's a planet a few light days away from here. Delta Vega. It has a lithium cracking station. We may be able to adapt some of its power packs to our engines. 
KIRK: And if we can't? We'll be trapped in orbit there. We haven't enough power to blast back out. 
SPOCK: It is the only possible way to get Mitchell off this ship. 
KIRK: If you mean strand Mitchell there, I won't do it. That station is fully automated. There's not a soul on the whole planet. Even the ore ships call only once every twenty years. 
SPOCK: Then you have one other choice. Kill Mitchell while you still can. 
KIRK: Get out of here. 
SPOCK: It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you still have time. 
KIRK: Will you try for one moment to feel? At least act like you've got a heart. We're talking about Gary. 
SPOCK: The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he waited too long to make his decision. I think we've both guessed that. 
KIRK: Set course for Delta Vega.

Star date 1313.1. We're now approaching Delta Vega. Course set for a standard orbit. This planet, completely uninhabited, is slightly smaller than Earth. Desolate, but rich in crystal and minerals. Kelso's task, transport down with a repair party, try to regenerate the main engines, save the ship. Our task, transport down a man I've known for fifteen years, and if we're successful, maroon him there.

[Sickbay]

MITCHELL: I'm thirsty. (cup slides under tap, is filled, then flies through the air to his hand) It's like a man who has been blind all of his life, suddenly being given sight. Sometimes I feel there's nothing I couldn't do, in time. Some people think that makes me a monster, don't they Jim. 
KIRK: Are you reading all our thoughts, Gary? 
MITCHELL: I can sense mainly worry in you, Jim. Safety of your ship. 
KIRK: What would you do in my place? 
MITCHELL: Probably just what Mister Spock is thinking now. Kill me while you can. (zaps Kirk and Spock with electric bolts) 
DEHNER: Stop it, Gary! 
MITCHELL: I also know we're orbiting Delta Vega, Jim. I can't let you force me down there. I may not want to leave this ship, not yet. I may want another place. I'm not sure yet just what kind of a world I can use. 
DEHNER: Use? 
MITCHELL: I don't understand it all yet, but if I keep growing, getting stronger, why, the things I could do, like, like maybe a god could do. (Kirk knocks him out)
KIRK: I want him unconscious for a while. (Dehner sedates him)

[Transporter room]

MITCHELL: You fools! Soon I'll squash you like insects. (Piper re-sedates him) 
KIRK: Energise.

[Planet surface]

KIRK: Can you do it, Lee? 
KELSO: Maybe, if we can bypass the fuel bins without blowing ourselves up. 
KIRK: Take him. 
DEHNER: There's not a soul on this planet but us?
KIRK: Nobody but us chickens, Doctor.

[Delta Vega Control room]

ALDEN: I think I've got the 203-R set, Lee.
KELSO: Good, Alden. Transport it up with you, will you?
ALDEN: Okay. 
KIRK: The fuel bins, Lee. Could they be detonated from here?
KELSO: A destruct switch? I guess I could wire one up right there.
KIRK: Do it.
SPOCK: He's regaining consciousness.

[Delta Vega Brig]

KIRK: Doctor Piper. I want only one medical officer here at any one time. The other will monitor him on the dispensary screen. 
DEHNER: I'd like to stay now, try to talk to him. 
MITCHELL: My friend James Kirk. remember those rodent things on Dimorus? The poisoned darts they threw? I took one meant for you. 
KIRK: And almost died. I remember. 
MITCHELL: So why be afraid of me now? 
KIRK: You've been testing your ability to take over the Enterprise. In the transporter room, you said something about us seeming like insects by comparison, squashing us if we got in your way. 
MITCHELL: I was drugged then. 
KIRK: Yes. In the Sickbay, you said if you were in my place, you'd kill a mutant like yourself. 
MITCHELL: Why don't you kill me then? Mister Spock is right and you're a fool if you can't see it. 
DEHNER: You don't mean that, Gary. 
MITCHELL: Man cannot survive if a race of true espers is born. In time you'll understand that. (tests the forcefield) 
KIRK: Gary. Gary, don't! 
MITCHELL: Jim. 
KIRK: His eyes went back to normal. 
SPOCK: Fighting the force field drained his strength, for a while at least. He could be handled now. 
MITCHELL: I'll just keep getting stronger. You know that, don't you.

[Bridge]

SCOTT: (having put new panel in a bridge station) It fits like a glove, Captain.

[Delta Vega Control room]

SCOTT [OC]: Oh, did Mister Spock get the phaser rifle we sent down? 
KIRK: I didn't order any (Spock enters with rifle) Affirmative. Landing party out. 
SPOCK: He tried to get through the force field again. His eyes changed back faster. He didn't become as weak. 
KIRK: Doctor Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong? 
SPOCK: Because she feels. I don't. All I know is logic. In my opinion we'll be lucky if we can repair this ship and get away in time. 
KELSO: Direct to the power bins. From here you could blow up this whole valley. 
KIRK: If Mitchell gets out, at your discretion, Lee, if sitting here, you think you're the last chance, I want you to hit that button.

Captain's log, Star date 1313.3. Note commendations on Lieutenant Kelso and the engineering staff. In orbit above us, the engines of the Enterprise are almost fully regenerated. Balance of the landing party is being transported back up. Mitchell, whatever he's become, keeps changing, growing stronger by the minute.

[Delta Vega Brig]

DEHNER: He's been like that for hours now. 
KIRK: Have Doctor Piper meet us in the control room with Kelso. We'll all transport up together. 
SPOCK: If he should try to stop us 
KIRK: Kelso will be on the destruct button until the last minute. I think he knows that. 
DEHNER: I'm staying behind with him.

[Delta Vega Control room]

KELSO: Fission chamber three checks out. The station seems to be running fine. 
SCOTT [OC]: You're a talented thief, Kelso. Everything you sent up seems to be fitting in place. 
KELSO: I'm kind of proud of the job we've done. We're going to be ready to transport up (a cable loops over his neck from behind and throttles him)

[Delta Vega Brig]

KIRK: You're leaving with the ship, Doctor. 
DEHNER: He is not evil. 
KIRK: I gave you an order, Doctor. 
MITCHELL: You should have killed me while you could, James. Command and compassion is a fool's mixture. (zaps Kirk and Spock then waves away the forcefield. He leads Dehner into his cell and we see in the mirror her eyes are like his now)

PIPER: It hit me, too, whatever it was. Kelso is dead, strangled. At least Spock's alive. 
KIRK: Doctor Dehner? 
PIPER: She went with Mitchell. 
KIRK: Don't give him a pill until after I'm gone. It's my fault Mitchell got as far as he did. Did you see their direction? 
PIPER: Yes, there was some morning light. They were headed across the valley, to the left of the pointed peaks. There's flatlands beyond. 
KIRK: When Mister Spock recovers, you'll both transport up immediately to the Enterprise. 
PIPER: But Captain 
KIRK: If you have not received a signal from me within twelve hours, you'll proceed at maximum warp to the nearest Earth base with my recommendation that this entire planet be subjected to a lethal concentration of neutron radiation. No protest on this, Mark. That's an order.

[Planet surface]

DEHNER: It would take almost a miracle to survive here. 
MITCHELL: Then I shall make one. Behold. (creates and oasis with flowers and a spring) You'll soon share this feeling, Elizabeth. To be like God, to have the power to make the world anything you want it to be. 
DEHNER: What's wrong? 
MITCHELL: A visitor. A very foolish man. You'll enjoy being a god, Elizabeth. Blasphemy? No. Let there be food. Kaferian apples. Whenever we visited that planet, I always favoured these. Can you hear me, James? You cannot see me. I'm not there. You follow the right path, James. You'll come to me soon. 
DEHNER: I can see him in my mind, too. 
MITCHELL: Go to him, Elizabeth, talk to him. Now that you're changing I want you to see just how unimportant they are.

DEHNER: Yes, it just took a little longer for it to happen to me. 
KIRK: You must help me Before it goes too far. 
DEHNER: What he's doing is right for him and me. 
KIRK: And for humanity? You're still human 
DEHNER: No, I 
KIRK: At least partly, you are, or you wouldn't be here talking to me. 
DEHNER: Earth is really unimportant. Before long, we'll be where it would have taken mankind millions of years of learning to reach. 
KIRK: What will Mitchell learn in getting there? Will he know what to do with his power? Will he acquire the wisdom? 
DEHNER: Please go back while you still can. 
KIRK: Did you hear him joke about compassion? Above all else, a god needs compassion. Mitchell! Elizabeth. 
DEHNER: What do you know about gods? 
KIRK: Then let's talk about humans, about our frailties. As powerful as he gets, he'll have all that inside him. 
DEHNER: Go back. 
KIRK: You were a psychiatrist once. You know the ugly, savage things we all keep buried, that none of us dare expose. But he'll dare. Who's to stop him? He doesn't need to care. Be a psychiatrist for one minute longer. What do you see happening to him? What's your prognosis, Doctor? 
DEHNER: He's coming. 
KIRK: Then watch him. Hang on to being a human for one minute longer. 
MITCHELL: I'm disappointed in you, Elizabeth. (phaser rifle has no effect on him) I've been contemplating the death of an old friend. He deserves a decent burial, at least. (a grave appears in the rock, with a tombstone engraved James R Kirk. A massive boulder on the cliff above is loosened) 
DEHNER: Stop it, Gary. 
MITCHELL: Morals are for men, not gods. 
KIRK: A god, but still driven by human frailty. Do you like what you see? 
MITCHELL: Time to pray, Captain. Pray to me. 
KIRK: To you? Not to both of you? 
MITCHELL: Pray that you die easily. 
KIRK: There'll only be one of you in the end. One jealous god. if all this makes a god, or is it making you something else? 
MITCHELL: Your last chance, Kirk. 
KIRK: Do you like what you see? Absolute power corrupting absolutely. (Dehner zaps Mitchell, he returns fire, she continues and his eyes return to normal)
DEHNER: Hurry. You haven't much time. (the two men punch and wrestle until Kirk raises a rock over his head)
KIRK: Gary, forgive me. (Mitchell's eyes glow again)
MITCHELL: For a moment, James, but your moment is fading. (they both fall into the grave, but Kirk leaps out first, grabs the rifle and brings the boulder down to entomb Mitchell)
DEHNER: I'm sorry. You can't know what it's like to be almost a god. (dies) 
KIRK: Enterprise from Captain Kirk, come in.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Captain's log, Star date 1313.8. Add to official losses, Doctor Elizabeth Dehner. Be it noted she gave her life in performance of her duty. Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell, same notation. I want his service record to end that way. He didn't ask for what happened to him. 
SPOCK: I felt for him, too. 
KIRK: I believe there's some hope for you after all, Mister Spock.

SPOCK: Check out the life-support systems. 
TORMOLEN: Right, sir. All life systems were off, sir.
SPOCK: Someone strangled this woman.
TORMOLEN The other four are back there.
SPOCK: Dead?
TORMOLEN: Right, sir.
SPOCK: Engineer at his post?
TORMOLEN He's frozen there like he didn't care.
SPOCK: The rest?
TORMOLEN: Well, better look for yourself, Mister Spock. One man was taking a shower fully clothed. (they split up, he takes off his glove to scratch his nose then puts it on the console. Something orange jumps onto his skin. Feeling the cold he puts the glove back on)
SPOCK: Be certain we expose ourselves to nothing. Spock here. Do you read, Enterprise? 
KIRK [OC]: Kirk, affirmative.
SPOCK: All station personnel are dead.
KIRK [OC]: What caused it?
SPOCK: Unknown, Captain. It's like nothing we've dealt with before.

Captain's Log: Stardate 1704.2. The science party we were to have picked up has been found dead. Life support systems had been turned off. Station personnel, frozen to death. Conditions highly unusual. Meanwhile, we remain in orbit to complete our mission, close scientific measurement of the break-up of this planet.

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: You received my signal, Mister Scott.
SCOTT: Yes, sir. Decontaminate.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Captain here.

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: Spock and Tormolen aboard, sir.

[Bridge]

SCOTT [OC]: We're holding them in the chamber for decontamination.
KIRK: Better have Medicine look them over too. Tell Mister Spock I'll meet him there in ten minutes. Kirk out.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: You're fine, Joe. Up and out of there. Mister Spock? Your pulse is two hundred and forty two, your blood pressure is practically nonexistent, assuming you call that green stuff in your veins blood.
SPOCK: The readings are perfectly normal for me, Doctor, thank you, and as for my anatomy being different from yours, I am delighted. Captain.
KIRK: How are they?
MCCOY: They're fine, Jim. 
TORMOLEN: Terrible, Captain. It was terrible. They were just sitting, like they didn't care. Whatever was happening, they didn't care. I keep wondering
KIRK: You keep wondering if man was meant to be out here. You keep wondering, you keep signing on. Any guesses, Mister Spock? Any idea of what happened down there?
SPOCK: I wish I could say, Captain. The circumstances were quite bizarre, however our record tapes may show us something.
TORMOLEN: Six dead. Six people dead.
KIRK: You'd better get some rest.
TORMOLEN: Yes, sir.
KIRK: Set up those tapes, Mister Spock. We'll see if the answers are there. (leaves with Spock)
CHAPEL: The lab status report, Doctor.
MCCOY: Oh, thank you, Christine.

[Briefing room]

SPOCK: Next tape, please.
RAND: Spectro-analysis tape, sir.
SPOCK: Thank you.
KIRK: Almost as though they were irrational, drugged. An engineer sitting there, apparently oblivious to everything. A woman strangled. A crewman with a phaser pistol in his hand.
SPOCK: He'd used the computer room as if it were an amusement gallery.
KIRK: And a fully clothed man frozen to death in a shower. If the image wasn't so ugly, it would be laughable. Not even a theory, gentlemen?
MCCOY: Definitely not drugs or intoxication. The bio-analysis on the tapes prove that conclusively.
SPOCK: It could be some form of space madness we've never heard of, but it would have to be caused by something. Our spectro-readings showed no contamination, no unusual elements present.
SCOTT: Or at least none your tricorders could register.
SPOCK: Instruments register only those things they're designed to register. Space still contains infinite unknowns.
KIRK: Earth Science needs the closest possible measurement of the breakup of this planet. To do this, we need the Enterprise in a critically tight orbit. Question. Could what happened down there to those people create any unusual danger to this vessel and crew?
SPOCK: We will need top efficiency, Captain. It'll be a tricky orbit. When the planet begins to go, there may be drastic changes in gravity, mass, magnetic field.
KIRK: The purpose of a briefing, gentlemen, is to get me answers based on your abilities and experience. In a critical orbit, there's no time for surprise. 
SCOTT: Unless you people on the Bridge start taking showers with your clothes on, my engines can pull us out of anything. We'll be warping out of orbit within a half second of getting your command.
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain.
KIRK: Kirk here.
UHURA [OC]: Scanners report sudden four degree shift in planet magnetic field. A change in mass also, sir.
SPOCK: It's beginning. Unusually rapid shifts.
KIRK: On our way, Lieutenant. I'll hold you to that half second, Scotty.

[Rec room]

SULU: Foil. It's a rapier. A thin sword.
RILEY: All right. So what do you do with it?
SULU: What do you mean, what do you do with it?
RILEY: Self-defence? Mayhem? Shish kebab?
SULU: You practice.
RILEY: For what?
SULU: Hi, Joey.
RILEY: Last week it was botany he was trying to get me interested in. I was supposed to be collecting leaves, plant specimens.
SULU: Your attitude is all wrong. Fencing tones the muscle, sharpens the eye, improves the posture. You tell him, Joey. Explain to him. Hey, Joey. You feeling all right?
TORMOLEN: Get off me! You don't rank me and you don't have pointed ears, so just get off my neck!
SULU: What's with him?
TORMOLEN: Nothing!
UHURA [OC]: Attention. Engine room on standby alert. All duty personnel to the Bridge. Acknowledge.
SULU: You sure you're all right now, Joe? We've got to leave.
TORMOLEN: We're all a bunch of hypocrites. Sticking our noses into something that we've got no business. What are we doing out here, anyway?
SULU: Take it easy, Joe.
TORMOLEN: We bring pain and trouble with us, leave men and women stuck out on freezing planets until they die. What are we doing out here in space? Good? What good? We're polluting it, destroying it. We've got no business being out here. No business.
RILEY: Take it easy, Joe.
SULU: Now calm down.
TORMOLEN: If a man was supposed to fly, he'd have wings. If he was supposed to be out in space, he wouldn't need air to breathe, wouldn't need life-support systems to keep him from freezing to death.
RILEY: Hey, Joey, put the knife down, huh?
SULU: You're all steamed up, Joe.
TORMOLEN: We don't belong here. It's not ours. Not ours. Destroying and watching. We don't belong. I don't belong. Six people died down there. Why do I deserve to live?
SULU: What are you doing, Joe?
RILEY: Hey, Joey, put the knife down. (grabs his arm) Don't be a fool.
TORMOLEN: Let go!
RILEY: You're just getting in a sweat about (three men struggle) Let me have the knife!
SULU: Joey, don't be a fool.
TORMOLEN: Let me go.
RILEY: Joey, give me the knife. (they fall to the floor, Tormolen gets stabbed in the stomach) Emergency! Rec room, area three nine. We need medics!

Captain's Log, supplemental. Our orbit tightening. Our need for efficiency, critical. But unknown to us, a totally new and unusual disease has been brought aboard.

[Bridge]

RILEY: Relative gravity increasing, sir.
KIRK: Compensate, Mister Riley.
RILEY: Yes, sir.
SULU: Magnetic field continuing to shift, sir. Planet continuing to shrink in mass.
KIRK: Mister Spock?
SPOCK: All scanning stations manned, all recorders functioning, Captain.
RILEY: Orbit steady now, sir.
SPOCK: Obviously, this planet is condensing more rapidly than expected. A valuable study. We may be seeing Earth's distant future. Before its sun went dark, this planet was remarkably similar to yours.
SULU: Helm answering nicely, Captain.
KIRK: Good.
UHURA: Communications status, Captain.
KIRK: Tormolen's record?
SPOCK: Psychiatric file, personality quotients. 
KIRK: Was he trying to kill himself?
SPOCK: It's doubtful he meant to. He was confused, self-tortured.
KIRK: Doesn't sound like the man I know.
SPOCK: His capacity for self-doubt has always been rather high. What puzzles me is what brought it to the surface with so much force.

[Sickbay]

CHAPEL: His breathing rate is dropping, Doctor.
MCCOY: Compensate with the respirator. Stand by to close. Closing.

[Bridge]

KIRK: What is it?
SULU: Relative gravity increase, sir. Like the planet reached out and yanked at us.
KIRK: Compensate. (adjusts Riley's controls) Compensate.
RILEY: Orbit steady now, sir. May be a little nervous, I guess.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: This shouldn't be happening. This man should be getting stronger. You sure the respirator's functioning properly? 
CHAPEL: Yes, Doctor.
MCCOY: Why is this man dying? Hypo.
CHAPEL: He's dead, Doctor.
MCCOY: The wounds were not that severe.

[Bridge]

MCCOY [OC]: This is McCoy. Captain Kirk to Sickbay.
KIRK: Uhura, monitor communications. Tell McCoy I'll be there when I can.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: Planet breakup is imminent, Captain. Shrinking in size at an increasing rate. As the planet continues to shrink in size, its surface moves away from us. 
KIRK: Forcing us to spiral down to maintain the same distance from it.
SPOCK: Exactly. We must be prepared to respond instantly to any sudden change.
KIRK: Engine room from Bridge.
SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, Captain.
KIRK: Tie into the helm, Scotty. If we should call for power, we'll want it fast.
SCOTT [OC]: No problem, sir. You'll have it.
SPOCK: Rate of compaction seems constant.
KIRK: Then I'll go see what the good doctor wants. Keep me informed of any change, Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Acknowledged.
SULU: Don't know if it's this planet or what happened with Joe. I'm sweating like a bridegroom.
RILEY: Yeah, me too.
SULU: Hey, why don't you come down to the gym with me, Kevin m'lad?
RILEY: Now?
SULU: Why not? Light workout will take the edge off.
RILEY: Sulu, what about. Hey, Sulu, don't be a fool!

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Intestinal damage wasn't that severe. I got to him in plenty of time. That man should still be alive. The only reason he died, Jim, is he didn't want to live. He gave up.
KIRK: That's a supposition, Doctor, not a fact.
MCCOY: Well, that may be. Maybe. I've lost patients before, but not like that. Not Joe's kind. That kind of man doesn't give up.
KIRK: Coincidence? Maybe. 
MCCOY: You mean that Joe was down on the planet surface and you're gonna ask me if it's connected.
KIRK: That's exactly what I was going to ask.
MCCOY: Jim, he was decontaminated. He's been medically checked. We've run every test we know for everything we know.
KIRK: That's not good enough.
MCCOY: Well, we're doing everything that's possible.
KIRK: Bones, I want the impossible checked out too.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Why isn't Mister Sulu at this station?
RILEY: Magnetic pull compensated for, sir. Orbit steady.
SPOCK: Take over here, Rand. (a male, not Janice)
RAND: Yes, sir.
SPOCK: You haven't answered my question. Where is Mister Sulu?
RILEY: Have no fear, O'Riley's here. One Irishman is worth ten thousand of you
SPOCK: You're relieved, Mister Riley. Lieutenant Uhura, take over this station.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
RILEY: Now that's what I like. Let the women work too. Universal suffrage.
SPOCK: Report to Sickbay, Mister Riley.
RILEY: Sickbay? Exactly where I was heading, sir.
SPOCK: Security. Mister Riley is headed for Sickbay. See to it he arrives. Captain Kirk to the Bridge.

[Sickbay]

RILEY: Where's Joe?
CHAPEL: Well.
RILEY: He died, didn't he.
CHAPEL: Yes.
RILEY: You know something? You have such lovely eyes, pretty lady. (touches her face)
CHAPEL: I know he was a friend of yours. This must be a terrible shock.
RILEY: You know what Joe's mistake was? He wasn't born an Irishman.

[Corridor]

SULU: (brandishing foil) Richelieu, beware! Stand. No farther. No escape for you. You either leave this bois bloodied, or with my blood on your swords. Cowards!

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura.
BRENT: Yes, sir.
KIRK: What were their symptoms?
SPOCK: Nonviolent at this stage. Slightly disoriented. Riley seemed rather pleased with himself, as if he were
KIRK: Irrational, or drugged.
SPOCK: Precisely.
KIRK: Security, Lieutenant Uhura.
UHURA: Yes, sir.
KIRK: Both Sulu and Riley, locate and confine. I want every crewman who comes in contact with them medically checked.
UHURA: Sir, level two, corridor three reports a disturbance. Mister Sulu chasing crewmen with a sword.
KIRK: Put Security on it.
SPOCK: Fascinating. A pattern is developing. First, Tormolen. Hidden personality traits being forced to the surface. Then Riley, who fancies himself a descendant of Irish kings, and now Sulu, who is at heart a swashbuckler out of your 18th century.
KIRK: Present condition of Psi 2000.
SPOCK: Gravity pull increasing. We've shifted to two percent and should stabilise our position.
KIRK: Helmsman, stabilise position.
BRENT: Helm is not answering to control.
KIRK: Warp us out of here.
BRENT: No response from engines, sir.
KIRK: Impulse power then. Blast us out of this orbit.
BRENT: Impulse engines also dead, sir.
SPOCK: Engine room, we need power!
KIRK: Mister Scott, acknowledge. Our controls are dead. Take her.
SULU: Richelieu, at last.
KIRK: Sulu, put that (discovers that the point is sharp) put that thing away.
SULU: For honour, Queen, and France! (lunges)
UHURA: Sulu.
SULU: Ah.
UHURA: Sulu, give me that.
SULU: I'll protect you, fair maiden.
UHURA: Sorry, neither.
SULU: Foul Richelieu. (distracted by Uhura's escape, Kirk is able to grab Sulu and Spock does a neck-pinch)
KIRK: I'd like you to teach me that sometime.
SPOCK: Take D'Artagnon here to Sickbay.
KIRK: Scotty, we need power. Engine room, acknowledge!
RILEY [OC]: You rang, sir?
KIRK: Who's this?

[Engineering]

RILEY: This is Captain Kevin Thomas Riley of the starship Enterprise.

[Bridge]

RILEY [OC]: And who is this?
KIRK: This is Captain Kirk. Get out of the engine room, navigator. Where's Mister Scott?
RILEY [OC]: I've relieved Mister Scott of his duties. Now, attention, cooks. This is your captain speaking. I would like double portions of ice cream for the entire crew.
KIRK: Clear that tube, will you?
UHURA: Yes, sir.
RILEY [OC]: And now, your captain will render an ancient Irish favourite. (sings) I'll take you home again Kathleen
SPOCK: Captain. At our present rate of descent, we have less than twenty minutes before we enter planet atmosphere.
KIRK: And burn up. I know, Mister Spock.
RILEY [OC]: Wild and wide to where your heart

Captain's Log, stardate 1704.4. Ship out of control, spiraling down towards planet Psi 2000. We have nineteen minutes of life left without engine power or helm control.

[Corridor outside Engineering]

KIRK: How did Riley get in there?
SCOTT: He ran in, said you wanted us on the Bridge.
KIRK: He's cut off both helm and power.
SCOTT: And he shut the door behind us and locked off the mechanism.
KIRK: Can't you get to the auxiliary?
SCOTT: I can't. He's hooked everything through the main panel in there. Get up to my office and pull the plans for this bulkhead. The only way to get that door open is to cut through these wall circuits here.

[Engineering]

RILEY: (singing) The roses all have left your cheeks. I've watched them fade away and die

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Status reports, all sections.
UHURA: Mister Spock, a fight in the aft wardroom. Security reports incidents among the crewmen are increasing.
SPOCK: Go to Alert Baker two. Seal off main sections.
UHURA: All decks, alert system B two. Repeat, go to alert condition Baker two. Seal off all main sections. Stand by.
SPOCK: We're going to seal off, Captain, if we can minimise the spread of whatever this is.
KIRK: Continue the alert, Lieutenant.
UHURA: I can't, sir. He's cut off the alert channels.

[Engineering]

RILEY: Lieutenant Uhura,

[Bridge]

RILEY [OC]: You've interrupted my song. I'm sorry, but there'll be no ice cream for you tonight.
KIRK: Cut him off.
UHURA: I can't, sir. There's no way to do it.
RILEY [OC]: Attention, crew. This is Captain Riley. There will be a formal dance in the bowling alley at nineteen hundred hours tonight.
SPOCK: No way, Captain. He controls the main power panels. He can override any channel from down there. Seventeen minutes left, sir. (ship is jolted severely)
MCCOY: Sickbay to Bridge.
KIRK: Can you tie me in to the Sickbay?

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: I'm getting you, Jim. Look, can you keep this beast level? I've got Sulu tranquillized and we're running tests on him.

[Bridge]

MCCOY [OC]: So far there's nothing unusual in his bloodstream. Body functions seem normal.
KIRK: Riley's the immediate problem, Doctor. Is there any way, anything you can do to snap him out of it?

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Negative, until I can get a little farther on these tests.

[Bridge]

RILEY [OC]: This is Captain Riley. Crew, I have some additional orders.

[Engineering]

RILEY: In the future, all female crew members will wear their hair loosely, about their shoulders.

[Bridge]

RILEY [OC]: And use restraint in putting on your makeup. Women, women should not look made up. And now, crew, I will render Kathleen one more time!
KIRK: Please, not again.

[Engineering]

RILEY: (singing) I'll take you home again, Kathleen (meanwhile, Scott is working in a Jefferies tube) I've watched them fade away and die.

[Corridor]

SCOTT: I've set the jumpers up there. Stand by 'til I give you a signal.

[Engineering]

RILEY: And tears bedim your loving eyes. Oh,

[Corridor outside Engineering]

RILEY [OC]: I will take you home Kathleen.
SCOTT: Engineering to Bridge. Try your helm. You'll have enough power to keep her stabilised. Here, let's have a look at that.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Sixteen minutes left, Captain. We've stabilised, but still spiraling down.
UHURA: Emergency signal, Captain. Both decks four and five. Fights and disorders.
KIRK: Get me Sickbay.
UHURA: I have no intercom for Sickbay. He keeps switching channels on me.
KIRK: See what you can do to help Doctor McCoy. Better check Scotty first. Move him faster. He's got to get through that bulkhead.

[Corridor] SPOCK: Crewman, report to the lab!
MOODY: (singing) I'll take you home again Janice 
SPOCK: What's going on?
RAND: Mister Spock, I'm trying to get to the Bridge and this crewman won't let me by.
SPOCK: Crewman, stand aside.
MOODY: Oh, yes, sir. I'll take you home again, Janice
RAND: Spock!

[Corridor outside Engineering]

SPOCK: Message from the captain.
SCOTT: Tell him I'm doing my best. If I cut through the wrong circuits
SPOCK: We have fourteen minutes left.
SCOTT: Even if we were under a full-scale attack I couldn't move any faster, not and maintain a safety factor.
SPOCK: At the rate you're proceeding, calculations show that you'll take a minute and a half more than we have left. You can't afford a safety factor.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Biopsy lab. Biopsy, where's my report? Biopsy, come in! Harrison, where's my report? I'm going to the lab.
CHAPEL: Sir?
MCCOY: Yes?
CHAPEL: The tranquillizer's wearing off.
MCCOY: Oh, good. I'll need him conscious now. Continue to examine him on circuits K one and three.
CHAPEL: Of course, Doctor.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Get him out of here.
RAND: I would have gotten here sooner, sir but Crewman Moody stopped me in the hallway.
KIRK: Take the helm.
RAND: Sir?
KIRK: Take the helm!
RAND: Yes, sir.
RILEY [OC]: Kathleen. And now, crew, one more time!
KIRK: At least try cutting him off!
UHURA: Sir, if I could cut him off, don't you think I
RILEY [OC]: I'll take you home again Kathleen 
UHURA: Yes, sir. I'll keep trying.
KIRK: Sorry.
RILEY [OC]: Across the ocean wild and wide 
KIRK: Scotty.
SCOTT [OC]: Engine room.
KIRK: We've got twelve minutes left. It'll take at least two or three of them to get the engines up to power now.
SCOTT [OC]: Then we'll make it, sir, if all goes right.
KIRK: Call me when you've cut through. I want to be there. Kirk out.

[Sickbay]

SPOCK: Nurse? Where is Doctor McCoy?
CHAPEL: He's gone to the lab.
SPOCK: Lab. Lab, respond please. Spock here. Lab!
CHAPEL: Mister Spock.
SPOCK: What is it, Nurse?
CHAPEL: Mister Spock, (takes his hand) the men from Vulcan treat their women strangely. At least, people say that, but you're part human too. I know you don't, you couldn't, hurt me, would you? I'm in love with you, Mister Spock. You, the human Mister Spock, the Vulcan Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Nurse, you should
CHAPEL: Christine, please. I see things, how honest you are. I know how you feel. You hide it, but you do have feeling. Oh, how we must hurt you, torture you.
SPOCK: I'm in control of my emotions.
CHAPEL: The others believe that. I don't. I love you. I don't know why, but I love you. I do love you just as you are. Oh, I love you.
SPOCK: I'm sorry.
UHURA [OC]: Captain is en route to Engineering, Mister Spock. Can you take the bridge? Acknowledge.
SPOCK: I am sorry.
CHAPEL: Christine.
SPOCK: Christine.
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Sickbay. Is Mister Spock there?

[Corridor]

UHURA [OC]: Mister Spock, would you please acknowledge? (Spock is struggling to keep his control)

[Corridor outside Engineering]

RILEY [OC]: I will take you home Kathleen 
SCOTT: Almost ready, sir.
RILEY [OC]: To where your heart will feel no pain. When the fields are fresh and green. I'll take you to your home
SCOTT: - Ready, sir.
KIRK: (to Security) Follow me through. Put your phasers on stun. Don't fire unless he's armed. Go.

[Engineering]

RILEY: I'll take. No dance tonight.
KIRK: Get him out of here.

[Briefing room]

SPOCK: (close to tears) I'm in control of my emotions. Control of my emotions. I am an officer. An officer. My duty. My duty is, is. My duty is to, to. Too late. I'm sorry. To. Two, four, six. Six. Six times six.

[Engineering]

KIRK: Scotty, we haven't got much time left.
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain.
KIRK: Kirk here.
UHURA [OC]: Entering planet's outer atmosphere, sir.
SCOTT: Captain.
KIRK: What is it?
SCOTT: He's turned the engines off. Completely cold. It will take thirty minutes to regenerate them.
UHURA [OC]: Ship's outer skin is beginning to heat, Captain. Orbit plot shows we have about eight minutes left.
KIRK: Scotty!
SCOTT: I can't change the laws of physics. I've got to have thirty minutes.

Captain's Log, supplemental. The Enterprise, spiraling down out of control. Ship's outer skin heating rapidly due to friction with planet atmosphere.

SCOTT: Maybe twenty two, twenty three minutes.
KIRK: Scotty, we've got six.
SCOTT: Captain, you can't mix matter and antimatter cold. We'd go up in the biggest explosion since
KIRK: We can balance our engines into a controlled implosion.
SCOTT: That's only a theory. It's never been done.
KIRK: Bridge, have you found Mister Spock yet?
SCOTT: If you wanted to chance odds of ten thousand to one, maybe, assuming we had a row of computers working weeks on the right formula.
UHURA: Mister Spock is not on the Bridge, Captain.

[Bridge]

SULU: (waking up screaming) I was on the Bridge. Hey Doc, what am I doing here?
MCCOY: McCoy to Bio. We've isolated it. Start preparing serum.
HARRISON [OC]: What, Doctor?
MCCOY: It's water. Somehow on this planet, water's changed to a complex chain of molecules.
HARRISON [OC]: What's that, Doctor?
MCCOY: That's how we missed it. It passed from man to man through perspiration. Once in the bloodstream, it acts like alcohol, depresses the centres of judgment, self-control. Now get someone to the lab. Tell them the serum works, and start preparing more.
SULU: Doc, will you let me out of here? I'm all right.
MCCOY: Release him.

[Briefing room]

SCOTT [OC]: Engineers, man your stations. Engine rooms, report. Cycling station, report. This will be an emergency restart of engines.
KIRK: Where have you been? What happened?
SPOCK: My mother. I could never tell her I loved her.
KIRK: We've got four minutes, maybe five.
SPOCK: An Earth woman, living on a planet where love, emotion, is bad taste.
KIRK: We've got to risk a full-power start. The engines were shut off. No time to regenerate them. Do you hear me? We've got to risk a full-power start!
SPOCK: I respected my father, our customs. I was ashamed of my Earth blood. (Kirk slaps him) Jim, when I feel friendship for you, I'm ashamed.
KIRK: (hitting him repeatedly) You've got to hear me! We need a formula. We've got to risk implosion!
SPOCK: t's never been done! Understand, Jim. I've spent a whole lifetime learning to hide my feelings. (finally hits Kirk back)
KIRK: We've got to risk implosion. It's our only chance.
SPOCK: It's never been done.
KIRK: Don't tell me that again, Science Officer! It's a theory. It's possible. We may go up into the biggest ball of fire since the last sun in these parts exploded, but we've got to take that one in ten thousand chance!
UHURA [OC]: Bridge to Captain. Engineer asked, did you find
KIRK: Yes, I found Mister Spock! I'm talking to Mister Spock, do you understand?
UHURA: Yes, sir. Three and a half minutes left, Captain.
KIRK: I've got it, the disease. Love. You're better off without it, and I'm better off without mine. This vessel, I give, she takes. She won't permit me my life. I've got to live hers.
SPOCK: Jim.
KIRK: I have a beautiful yeoman. Have you noticed her, Mister Spock? You're allowed to notice her. The Captain's not permitted
SPOCK: Jim, there is an intermix formula.
KIRK: Now I know why it's called she.
SPOCK: It's never been tested. It's a theoretical relationship between time and antimatter.
KIRK: Flesh woman to touch, to hold. A beach to walk on. A few days, no braid on my shoulder.
SCOTT: Captain.
KIRK: Scotty, help.
SPOCK: Stand by to intermix. I'll call the formulae in from the Bridge.
UHURA [OC]: Entering upper stratosphere, Captain. Skin temperature now twenty one hundred seventy degrees.
KIRK: I've got to hang on. Tell them. Clear the corridors, the turbo lift. Hurry. (Scott and Spock leave) Never lose you. Never.

[Turbolift]

KIRK: Bridge.

[Bridge]

(McCoy gives Kirk a hypo as he leaves the turbolift) 
KIRK: Engine room. We're set. Hyperbolic course.
BRENT: Direction, sir?
KIRK: Direction. Direction. It doesn't matter. The way we came.
SULU: Course laid in, sir.

[Engineering]

SPOCK: Fuel temperature.
SCOTT: Level.

[Bridge]

KIRK: (gazing at Janice) No beach to walk on.
RAND: Sir?

[Engineering]

SPOCK: Raise antimatter eight and forty degrees.
SCOTT: That'll take four minutes.
SPOCK: We haven't the time. We'll have to risk it. Bridge, we're ready.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Engage. 
SPOCK: Are you all right, Jim?
KIRK: Are you? (Spock nods)
MCCOY: We found a cure. We're over that part of it. 
SPOCK: Obviously, we were successful. The engines imploded.
SULU: Captain, my velocity gauge is off the scale.
SPOCK: Engine power went off the scale as well. We're now travelling faster than is possible for normal space.
KIRK: Checked elapsed time, Mister Sulu.
SULU: My chronometer's running backwards, sir.
KIRK: Time warp. We're going backward in time. Helm, begin reversing power. Slowly.
SULU: Helm answering, sir. Power reversing.
SPOCK: We're back to normal time, Captain.
KIRK: Engines ahead. Warp one.
SULU: Warp one, sir.
KIRK: Mister Spock.
SPOCK: Yes, sir.
KIRK: The time warp. What did it do to us?
SPOCK: We've regressed in time seventy one hours. It is now three days ago, Captain. We have three days to live over again. 
KIRK: Not those last three days.
SPOCK: This does open some intriguing prospects, Captain. Since the formula worked, we can go back in time, to any planet, any era.
KIRK: We may risk it someday, Mister Spock. Resume course to our next destination, Mister Sulu.
SULU: Course laid in, sir.
KIRK: Steady as she goes.
KIRK: That should make a good specimen. 
SULU: (holding pink animal with a horn) Temperature's starting to drop. 
KIRK: Yeah. At night it gets down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero. 
SULU: That's nippy. 
FISHER: Hey! 
KIRK: What happened? 
FISHER: I fell off that bank, sir. Cut my hand. 
KIRK: Let's see it. Get back to the ship. Report to the Sickbay. 
FISHER: Yes, sir. Geological Technician Fisher. Ready to beam up.

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: Right. Locked onto you. Energise. Coadjutor engagement. 
WILSON: What happened? 
FISHER: I took a flop. 
WILSON: Onto what? 
FISHER: I don't know. Some kind of yellow ore. 
SCOTT: Magnetic. Decontaminate that uniform. 
FISHER: Yes, sir. (;eaves) 
SCOTT: That acted like a burnout. 
KIRK [OC]: Captain Kirk ready to beam up. 
SCOTT: Just one moment, Captain. It checks out okay now. You better go get a synchronic meter so we can double-check. 
WILSON: Yes sir. 
SCOTT: All right, Captain. Locked onto you. (Kirk stumbles as he leaves the platform) Are you all right, Captain? 
KIRK: Yes, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy. 
SCOTT: Let me give you a hand. 
KIRK: I can't get through there. Nothing serious. Don't leave the transporter room unattended. 
SCOTT: Wilson will be right back, sir. 
(both leave, and another Kirk materialises on the pad)

Captain's Log, stardate 1672.1. Specimen-gathering mission on planet Alpha 177. Unknown to any of us during this time, a duplicate of me, some strange alter ego, had been created by the transporter malfunction.

[Transporter room]

WILSON: Captain? Are you all right, sir? Can I give you a hand, sir? Captain?

[Corridor]

UHURA [OC]: Bridge to all decks. Section duty officers, check communication lines. 
KIRK: Thank you. 
SCOTT: It might profit you to let Doctor McCoy give you the once-over. 
KIRK: All right, Engineer, I'll have my engines looked to.

[Kirk's quarters]

RAND: Ship's manifests, sir. I think they're in order now. 
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman. 
RAND: I've checked 
KIRK: That's all. 
RAND: Yes, sir. (leaves Kirk to lie down on bed)

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: You picked a good day, Fisher. Business has been lousy. What'd you do, take a fall on purpose so you could get a little vacation? 
KIRK: Saurian brandy. 
Back to duty status, Fisher. I have no sympathy for clumsiness. 
FISHER: No, sir. The hand's much better, sir. (leaves) 
MCCOY: What can I do for you, Jim? 
KIRK: (grabbing him by the neck) I said, give me the brandy! (leaves with bottle and goes to Rand's quarters)

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK: Yeah. 
SPOCK [OC]: Mister Spock. 
KIRK: Come in. Yes, Mister Spock, what is it? 
SPOCK: Is there something I can do for you, Captain? 
KIRK: Like what? 
SPOCK: Well, Doctor McCoy seemed to think I should check on you. 
KIRK: That's nice. Come on, Spock, I know that look. What is it? 
SPOCK: Well, our good doctor said that you were acting like a wild man, demanded brandy. 
KIRK: Our good doctor's been putting you on again. 
SPOCK: Hmm. Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion Captain, I'll get back to my work. 
KIRK: I'll tell him you were properly annoyed. 
SPOCK: Captain.

[Transporter room]

KIRK: What is it, Scotty? 
SCOTT: Transporter breakdown. Continue circuit testing. We beamed up this animal and, well, look for yourself. It's in this specimen case. (opens lid to reveal angry pink animal) 
KIRK: Yes? 
SCOTT: A few seconds after they sent this one up through the transporter, that duplicate appeared. Except it's not a duplicate, it's an opposite. Two of the same animal, but different. One gentle, this. One mean and fierce, that. Some kind of savage, ferocious opposite. Captain, we don't dare send Mister Sulu and the landing party up. If this should happen to a man. 
KIRK: Oh, my.

[Rand's quarters]

RAND: Oh! Captain, you startled me. Is there something that you? Can I help you, Captain? 
KIRK: Jim will do here, Janice. 
RAND: Oh. 
KIRK: You're too beautiful to ignore. Too much woman. We've both been pretending too long. (grabs her) Stop pretending. Let's stop pretending. Come here, Janice. Don't fight me. Don't fight me, Janice. (kisses her) 
RAND: Captain! 
KIRK: Just a minute, Janice. Just a minute! (forces her onto the floor, she scratches his face and gets away to the door which opens just as Fisher is passing by) 
RAND: Call Mister Spock! Call Mister Spock!

[Corridor]

FISHER: Geological Technician Fisher. Deck twelve, section (Kirk grabs him and hits him, hard)

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK: Me? My yeoman said that? I've been resting here since you left me. Alone, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Doctor McCoy reports that you demanded this brandy in Sickbay and left with it. I found this bottle in Yeoman Rand's quarters. 
KIRK: Not true. I haven't been to the Sickbay. Let's find out what's going on.

[Turbolift]

KIRK: Sickbay. (just missing the other Kirk nursing grazed knuckles, who goes into his quarters)

[Sickbay]

RAND: Then he kissed me and he said that we, that he was the Captain and he could order me. I didn't know what to do. When you mentioned the feelings we'd been hiding, and you started talking about us. 
KIRK: Us? 
RAND: Well, he is the captain. I couldn't just. You started hurting me. I had to fight you, and scratch your face. 
KIRK: Yeoman, look at me. Look at me, look at my face. Are there any scratches? 
RAND: I was sure I scratched you. I was frightened. Maybe 
KIRK: Yeoman. I was in my room. It wasn't me. 
RAND: Sir, Fisher saw you, too. 
KIRK: Fisher saw? 
RAND: If it hadn't been. I can understand. I don't want to get you into trouble. I wouldn't have even mentioned it! 
KIRK: It wasn't me! 
FISHER: It was you, sir. 
KIRK: Do you know what you're saying? 
FISHER: Yes, I know what I'm saying. 
MCCOY: Back to that bed, bucko. Come on, let's go. 
SPOCK: You can go now, Yeoman. (Rand leaves) There's only one logical answer. We have an impostor aboard.

Captain's Log, stardate 1672.9. On the planet's surface, temperatures are beginning to drop, our landing party there in growing jeopardy. Due to the malfunction of the ship's transporter, an unexplained duplicate of myself definitely exists.

[Transporter room]

KIRK: How did all this happen? 
SCOTT: I don't know sir, but when Fisher came up, his suit was covered with a soft yellow ore that had highly unusual properties. It may have caused an overload. Can't tell, not yet. 
KIRK: Does the transporter work at all? 
SCOTT: Yes sir, but we don't dare bring up the landing party. It might be duplicated like this animal. 
KIRK: How long will it take you to find the trouble? 
SCOTT: Can't say, sir. 
KIRK: We just can't leave those four men down there. It's getting dark. They'll die. The surface temperature of that planet goes down to a hundred and twenty degrees below zero at night. 
SCOTT: We're doing everything we can, sir. 
KIRK: Yes, I know, Scotty. 
SPOCK: About your double, Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, er, yes, we'll have to find him. Search parties, Mister Spock. Organise search parties. 
SPOCK: We can't take a chance on killing it. We have no previous experience, no way of knowing what would happen to you. 
KIRK: Yes, that's right. We don't know, but the men have to be armed. The men are to be armed, with their phasers locked, I repeat, locked, on setting number one. There can't be any chance of him being killed. He's to be taken without. If the men are forced to fire, he can't be killed. 
SPOCK: How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are to capture you? 
KIRK: Tell them. 
SPOCK: The search parties, Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what happened. It's a good crew. They deserve to know. 
SPOCK: Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realise you can't announce the full truth to the crew. You're the Captain of this ship. You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew. You can't afford the luxury of being anything less than perfect. If you do, they lose faith, and you lose command. 
KIRK: Yes, I do know that, Mister Spock. What I don't know is why I forgot that just now. Mister Spock, if you see me slipping again, your orders, your orders are to tell me. 
SPOCK: Understood, Captain.

Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1. Something has happened to me. Somehow, in being duplicated, I have lost my strength of will. Decisions are becoming more and more difficult.

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK [OC]: This is the Captain speaking. There's an impostor aboard the ship, a man who looks exactly like me and is pretending to be me. This man is dangerous. Utmost caution is to be observed. All crew members are to arm themselves. The impostor may be identified by scratches on his face. Repeat, the impostor may be identified by scratches on his face.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Section chiefs, assign personnel to the search. All search parties

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK [OC]: report to Mister Spock for assignment.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Something? 
SPOCK: About the phaser weapons to be set for stunning force and locked. 
KIRK: Oh, yes, yes. All hand phasers must be set on base cycle, stunning force.

[Kirk's quarters]

KIRK [OC]: The impostor is not to be injured. Use minimum force. Repeat, the imposter 
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk! 
KIRK [OC]: Is not to be injured. 
KIRK: I'm Captain Kirk. I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! (goes to mirror, covers scratches with makeup, opens door) Wilson! 
WILSON: Sir? 
KIRK: Wilson, give me your phaser. 
WILSON: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: How have you been? 
WILSON: Fine, sir. (Kirk grabs and hits him)

[Planet surface]

KIRK [OC]: How's it going down there, Mister Sulu? 
SULU: It's already twenty degrees below zero. Can't exactly

[Briefing room]

SULU [OC]: call it balmy. 
KIRK: Isn't there any way we can help them? 
SPOCK: Thermal heaters were transported down. They duplicated. They won't operate. 
KIRK: Then we've got to get those men up. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Spock here. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Transporter Technician Wilson found injured near the Captain's cabin. He says the impostor attacked him, called him by name, took his hand phaser. 
SPOCK: Acknowledged. Continue the search. 
KIRK: We've got to find him before he, but how? 
SPOCK: Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has your knowledge of the ship, its crew, its devices. This being the case, perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move. Knowing how the ship is laid out, where would you go to elude a mass search? 
KIRK: The lower levels. The Engineering deck.

[Engineering]

SPOCK: Set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to kill. What about your phaser, Captain? Don't you think we ought to get some help, Captain? 
KIRK: No. I don't want anyone else to see the 
SPOCK: Captain, you ordered me to tell you. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, if I'm to be the Captain, I've got to act like one. 
(they split up to search, and Kirk comes face to face with himself) 
KIRK: You can't hurt me. You can't kill me. You can't. Don't you understand? I'm part of you. You need me. I need you. 
OTHER KIRK: I don't need you. (Spock neck-pinches him, and his phaser fire hits a panel instead)

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: He'll be regaining consciousness soon, and not knowing what his physical state is, I don't think I dare give him a tranquilizer of any kind. I think we'd better bind him. 
KIRK: Yes. yes, all right. What's the matter with me? 
SPOCK: Judging from my observations, Captain, you're rapidly losing the power of decision. 
MCCOY: You have a point, Spock? 
SPOCK: Yes, always, Doctor. We have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms, the roles of good and evil in a man. His negative side, which you call hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people express as compassion, love, tenderness. 
MCCOY: It's the Captain's guts you're analysing. Are you of that, Spock? 
SPOCK: Yes, and what is it that makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, if you will, properly controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength. Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you. 
KIRK: What is your point, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: If your power of command continues to weaken, you'll soon be unable to function as Captain. You must be prepared for that. 
MCCOY: You have your intellect, Jim. You can fight with that! 
KIRK: For how long? 
SPOCK: If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, Captain, understand it's the way I am. 
SCOTT [OC]: Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
SCOTT [OC]: Mister Scott, sir, on the lower level of the Engineering deck.

[Engineering]

SCOTT: I've found a new trouble with the transporter. The casing has a wide gap ripped in it. (the phaser damage) The main circuits

[Sickbay]

SCOTT [OC]: have been burned through. The abort control circuit is gone altogether.

[Planet surface]

SULU: Can you give us a status report, Captain? Temperature's still dropping. Now forty one degrees below zero. 
KIRK [OC]: We've located the trouble. It shouldn't be much longer. 
SULU: Do you think you might be able to find a long rope somewhere and lower us down a pot of hot coffee?

[Sickbay]

KIRK: I'll see what we can do. 
SULU [OC]: Rice wine will do, if you're short on coffee. 
KIRK: Engineering deck, Kirk here. 
SCOTT [OC]: Scott here, Captain. 
KIRK: That unit, Scotty, status report. 
SCOTT [OC]: The transporter unit ioniser. Nothing much left of it, sir. 
KIRK: How bad is it? 
SCOTT [OC]: We can't repair it in less than a week.

Captain's Log, stardate 1673.5. Transporter still inoperable. My negative self is under restraint in Sickbay. My own indecisiveness growing. My force of will steadily weakening. On the planet, condition critical. Surface temperature is seventy five degrees below zero, still dropping.

[Planet surface]

SULU: (using phaser to heat rocks) I think we ought to give room service another call. That coffee's taking too long. Enterprise, this is Sulu.

[Briefing room]

KIRK: Kirk here, Mister Sulu. 
SULU [OC]: Hot line direct to the Captain. Are we that far gone? 
KIRK: I gave everybody the afternoon off. I'm watching the store.

[Planet surface]

KIRK [OC]: How is it down there? 
SULU: Oh, lovely, except that the frost is building up. We're using hand phasers to heat the rocks. One phaser quit on us, three still operating. Any possibility of getting us back aboard before the skiing season opens down here?

[Briefing room]

SPOCK: This is Spock, Mister Sulu. You'll have to hold on a little longer. There's no other way. Survival procedures, Mister Sulu. 
SULU [OC]: Per your training programme, Mister Spock.

[Sickbay]

(other Kirk is screaming) 
KIRK: What happened? 
MCCOY: Apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication process. A fact I failed to consider. 
KIRK: He's not dying? 
KIRK: Yes, he is. 
OTHER KIRK: Help me. 
KIRK: How can he die? Can I survive without him? 
MCCOY: I don't know, Jim. 
KIRK: Don't be afraid. Here's my hand. Hold on. You don't have to be afraid. I won't let go. Hold on. You won't be afraid if you use your mind and think! Think! You can do it. That's it! 
MCCOY: Jim, he is back! Jim, you can use that brandy now. In fact, I'll join you. 
KIRK: I have to take him back inside myself. I can't survive without him. I don't want him back. He's like an animal, a thoughtless, brutal animal, and yet it's me. Me. 
MCCOY: Jim, you're no different than anyone else. We all have our darker side. We need it! It's half of what we are. It's not really ugly, it's human. 
KIRK: Human. 
MCCOY: Yes, human. A lot of what he is makes you the man you are. God forbid I should have to agree with Spock, but he was right. Without the negative side, you wouldn't be the Captain. You couldn't be, and you know it. Your strength of command lies mostly in him. 
KIRK: What do I have? 
MCCOY: You have the goodness. 
KIRK: Not enough. I have a ship to command. 
MCCOY: The intelligence, the logic. It appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from. For you see, he was afraid and you weren't. 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain Kirk. 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here. Would you come to the transporter room. We think we may have found an answer. 
KIRK: Coming.

[Transporter room]

KIRK: What is it? 
SCOTT: We've found a way to get the transporter working, sir. 
SPOCK: We've attached some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference. Tied directly into the impulse engines, there shouldn't be more than a five point variation in the velocity balance. I suggest we send the animal through. Captain. 
KIRK: Yes, yes. Go ahead. 
SCOTT: (opening box with angry animal in it) I'll grab him by the scruff of the neck and hold him as long as I can. 
KIRK: Don't hurt him. 
SPOCK: It's painless and quick. The animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes. (sedates it) 
SCOTT: If this doesn't work, I don't know what will. 
SPOCK: Energise. Reverse. 
SPOCK: The shock of putting him back together seems to have been too much for him. 
MCCOY: He's dead, Jim.

Captain's Log, stardate 1673.1. Entry made by Second Officer Spock. Captain Kirk retains command of this vessel, but his force of will rapidly fading. Condition of landing party critical. Transporter unit still under repair.

[Sickbay]

MCCOY: Autopsy in-depth. Hurry. I don't know. Animal could have died of some kind of shock. 
SPOCK: For once, I agree with you. 
MCCOY: I said could have, Mister Spock. We won't know until we get a full post-mortem. 
SPOCK: No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified, confused. It was split into two halves and suddenly thrust back together again. Thus shock induced by blind terror. 
KIRK: Yes, yes, that sounds likely. 
SPOCK: It couldn't understand. You can. You have your intelligence controlling your fear. 
KIRK: Get the transporter room ready. 
MCCOY: Could be, if, maybe. All guesswork so far. Just theory. Jim, why don't you give me a chance to do an autopsy and let Spock check the transporter circuits again. 
KIRK: That sounds, sounds reasonable. We should double-check everything. 
SPOCK: Aren't you forgetting something, Captain? 
KIRK: No, I don't think I've for 
SPOCK: Your men on the planet surface. How much time do they have left? 
KIRK: Yes, that's right. The men. We have to take the chance, Bones. Their lives 
MCCOY: Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim. Suppose death was caused by transporter malfunction. Then you'd die. They'd die, anyway. Jim, you can't risk your life on a theory! 
SPOCK: Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor. I have a human half, you see, as well as an alien half, submerged, constantly at war with each other. Personal experience, Doctor. I survive it because my intelligence wins over both, makes them live together. Your intelligence would enable you to survive as well. 
KIRK: Help me. Somebody make the decision. 
SPOCK: Are you relinquishing your command, Captain? 
KIRK: No. No, I'm not. 
MCCOY: Well then, we can't help you, Jim. The decision is yours. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, ready the transporter room. Bones, continue the autopsy. 
UHURA [OC]: Captain Kirk, I have a tie-in with Sulu now. 
KIRK: Kirk here.

[Planet surface]

SULU: Captain K-Kirk, Sulu here. One hundred seventeen below. Can't last much longer.

[Sickbay]

SULU [OC]: Can't see clearly, Doctor, to read top indicator. Think the cold penetrating communicator. Two men unconscious. No time. No. Can't wait. No time. 
KIRK: Mister Sulu. Mister Sulu. Can't wait. Can't let them die. 
OTHER KIRK: What are you going to do? 
KIRK: Go through the transporter, both of us. 
OTHER KIRK: There's nothing I can do to stop you. 
KIRK: It's what I have to do. It's what I have to do. What we have to do. 
OTHER KIRK: I won't fight you anymore. Oh, I feel so weak. I'll be glad when this is over. (grabs Kirk and knocks him out)

[Corridor]

KIRK: Janice, hello. 
RAND: Captain, I 
KIRK: Yeoman, I owe you an explanation. 
RAND: No. 
KIRK: Yes, I do. The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a duplicate. The animal part of me came to your cabin. He even scratched me to make us look more alike. I'd like the chance to explain it to you. You don't mind if I come to your cabin later? 
RAND: No, sir. 
KIRK: (enters turbolift) Bridge.

[Bridge]

FARRELL: No word from Mister Sulu, sir. 
OTHER KIRK: Prepare to leave orbit, Mister Farrell. Well? 
FARRELL: Captain! 
OTHER KIRK: I gave you an order, Mister Farrell. 
FARRELL: But what about 
OTHER KIRK: They can't be saved. Prepare to leave orbit. 
FARRELL: Yes, sir. 
SPOCK: Captain, I thought the plan 
OTHER KIRK: I've changed my mind. Man your station, Mister Spock. (McCoy enters with another Kirk, identically dressed) Grab him. He's the impostor. 
MCCOY: No! 
OTHER KIRK: McCoy, he's fooled you. 
MCCOY: He (the one in the captain's chair) attacked him. 
OTHER KIRK: Mister Spock, you know who I am. You know what that is. 
FARRELL: Mister Spock, which one? What do we do? 
SPOCK: We'll let the captain handle this. 
OTHER KIRK: I'm the captain. Isn't that obvious? Look at his face. Remember the scratches? Look how he's tried to hide them. He wants you to think that he's Captain Kirk. You know who I am. 
KIRK: Yes, I know. 
OTHER KIRK: You want to kill me, don't you? Farrell, James, grab him. He'll destroy the ship! I'm the Captain. Don't you understand? I'm captain of the ship! (starts attacking the crew) I'm the captain! This is my ship! My ship! It's mine! I'll kill you. 
KIRK: Can half a man live? 
OTHER KIRK: Take another step, you'll die. 
KIRK: Then we'll both die. 
OTHER KIRK: Please, I don't want to. Don't make me. Don't make me. (Kirk takes phaser off him) I don't want to go back. Please! I want to live! 
KIRK: You will. Both of us. 
OTHER KIRK: I want to live!

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: You'll have to hold on to him, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Captain? 
KIRK: If this doesn't work. 
SPOCK: Understood, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Ready. (beams them out) 
MCCOY: Well, Mister Spock? (one figure is beamed back) Jim? 
KIRK: Get those men aboard fast. 
SPOCK: Right away, Captain. 
MCCOY: (as the party is wheeled away) Severe exposure and frostbite, but I think they'll make it. How do you feel, Jim? 
KIRK: How? I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see.

[Bridge]

FARRELL: Status report, green. 
SPOCK: All sections report ready, sir. 
KIRK: Good. Thank you, Mister Spock, from both of us. 
SPOCK: Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir? 
KIRK: The impostor's back where he belongs. Let's forget him. 
RAND: Captain? The impostor told me what happened, who he really was, and I'd just like to say that. Well, sir, what I'd like is 
KIRK: Thank you, Yeoman. 
SPOCK: The, er, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you say, Yeoman? 
KIRK: This is the Captain speaking. Navigator, set in course correction. Helmsman, steady as she goes.

Captain's log, Stardate 1329.8. The U.S.S. Enterprise in pursuit of an unidentified vessel.
[Bridge]

SULU: There he is, sir. Centre screen. Still trying to run away from us, sir. 
KIRK: Don't lose him, Mister Sulu.
SULU: No, sir.
KIRK: Earth ship, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: Difficult to say, Captain. We're getting no registration beam from it.
SCOTT: If it is, he'll soon overload his engines.
SPOCK: Sir, he's pushing his engines too hard. 
SULU: Changing course again. He knows we're after him all right.
KIRK: Stay with him, Mister Sulu. Communication?
UHURA: I've tried all frequencies, sir. He refuses to answer. Unless he's not receiving us. 
KIRK: He's receiving us alright. 
SPOCK: Approaching an asteroid belt, Captain. Schiller rating three five. 
KIRK: Deflectors on, Mister Farrell. 
SULU: He's seen the asteroids too, sir. 
KIRK: Stay with him. He'll try to lose us in them. 
SULU: If one hits him. 
SPOCK: Sensor reading on the vessel. I make it out as a small class J cargo ship, and his engines are super-heating. 
KIRK: Try to warn him. If he loses power now 
FARRELL: There go his engines, sir. 
SULU: He's drifting into the asteroid belt, Captain. 
FARRELL: He's had it, unless we put our deflector screen around him. 
SCOTT: Captain, if we try, we'll overload our own engines. He's too far away. 
KIRK: Cover him with our deflector screen, Mister Farrell. Scotty, Spock, stand by in the transporter room. 
SCOTT: Aye, sir. (they leave) 
FARRELL: We're protecting him, sir. We won't be able to hold it long. 
SULU: We're overloading, Captain. Engine temperatures climbing. 
CREWMAN [OC]: This is the Engine room. Temperatures are passing the danger line. 
FARRELL Our deflector screen's weakening, sir. We can't protect them much longer. (lights flicker)
SULU: That was one of our lithium crystal circuits, sir. 
KIRK: Bridge to transporter room. If you don't start beaming that crew over soon 
SCOTT [OC]: They're not answering our signal. There's nothing to lock onto. 
SULU (lights go out again) Another circuit, sir. 
UHURA: I'm getting a distress signal call from them, sir. 
KIRK: Scotty, we're getting a distress signal.

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: We're locked onto something, Captain. 
MUDD: Meaning no ingratitude, gentlemen, but just where is it I find meself? 
MCCOY: You're aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. 
MUDD: It's really a darn beautiful ship, isn't it? Really a beautiful ship. Oh, the name, gentlemen, is Walsh, Captain Leo Walsh. 
SPOCK: How many more in your crew? 
MUDD: Just a few more. 
SCOTT: Your vessel's breaking up, man. If we don't get them over here right now 
MUDD: We couldn't be sure you was a friendly vessel, now could we. Ah, but the three will be in position about by now.

[Bridge]

SULU: Another lithium circuit. Now supplementing with battery power, sir. 
KIRK: Scotty, how many of them did you get aboard? 
SCOTT [OC]: Only one, sir, but we've locked onto three more.

[Transporter room]

SPOCK: What's wrong? 
SCOTT: I don't know, sir. With those three lithium crystals gone 
SPOCK: It'll take longer on battery power. 
MCCOY: Never trusted this.

[Bridge]

FARRELL: There she goes. 
SULU: Asteroid hit him dead centre.

[Transporter room]

KIRK [OC]: Bridge to transporter room. Their vessel has been hit by an asteroid. It's gone. Did you get the crew off? 
SCOTT: Not yet, sir, but we've hooked onto something. (three women beam in, the men are transfixed) 
KIRK [OC]: Kirk to transporter room. Report. 
MUDD: It's all right, darlings. We're in good hands.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Bridge to transporter room. 
FARRELL: We're clearing the asteroid belt now, Captain. 
KIRK: Deflector screen down, Mister Farrell. Save the power.

[Transporter room]

KIRK [OC]: Captain to transporter room. Are you reading me or not, Mister Scott? Bridge to transporter room. How many did we get off? 
SCOTT: Oh, er, four in all, sir. 
KIRK [OC]: If that captain can walk, I want him in my cabin immediately. Correction,

[Bridge]

KIRK: I want him there whether he can walk or not. Kirk out.

[Transporter room]

MUDD: That fellow sounded a mite upset, didn't he? 
MCCOY: Yes. Yes, they are. 
SPOCK: Curious. You're certain this was everyone aboard, Mister Walsh? No other crewmen? 
MUDD: Oh, no, that's everyone, all right, but so far as the ladies actually being the crew 
SPOCK: You can explain that to the Captain. (the group leave) 
MCCOY: Amen to that, Scotty.

SPOCK: Deck twelve. 
MUDD: You're part Vulcanian, aren't you. Ah well then, a pretty face doesn't affect you at all, does it. That is, unless you want it to. You can save it, girls. This type can turn himself off from any emotion. 
EVE: I apologise for what he said, sir. He's used to buying and selling people. 
MUDD: I'll handle the conversation, darling.

[Captain's quarters]

KIRK: Come. 
SPOCK: The Commander of the transport to see you, Captain. 
KIRK: Good. Now, if you don't mind telling 
EVE: Hello. 
KIRK: And the ladies? Is this your crew, Captain? 
MUDD: Well, no, Captain. This is me cargo.

Captain's log, Stardate 1329.1. We've taken aboard from unregistered transport vessel its captain and, and three unusual females. These women have a mysterious magnetic effect on the male members of my crew, including myself. Explanation unknown at present.

[Captain's quarters]

MUDD: Well, how the devil am I supposed to know this is a starship, Captain? Here I am with a cargo of young lovelies. A strange ship comes up alongside. Well. naturally I did my best to evade you. And starship Captain or no, you exceeded your authority when you drove me and mine into a shower of asteroids. 
KIRK: Your name, please. 
MUDD: Walsh. Leo Walsh. You destroyed me ship, Captain. 
KIRK: Mister Walsh, I'm convening a ship's hearing on your actions. Mister Spock will supply you with any legal information you may need for your defence. 
MUDD: You're a hard-nosed one, Captain. 
KIRK: And you're a liar, Mister Walsh. I think we both understand each other. Security! Escort Mister Walsh to his quarters. Confine him there.

[Bridge]

SULU: You're on duty, Johnny-o. Back to reality. 
FARRELL: You can feel their eyes when they look at you, like something grabbing hold of you. Did you notice that? 
SULU: I noticed. How I noticed. Come on, Johnny. 
SCOTT: We've got trouble, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: I'm well aware of that, Mister Scott. 
SCOTT: One lithium crystal left, and that with a hairline split at the base. 
SPOCK: Better rig a by-pass circuit. 
SCOTT: Can't. We blew the whole converter assembly. 
KIRK [OC]: Kirk here. 
SPOCK: Needed on the bridge, Captain.

[Briefing room]

WOMEN: Harry! Where were you? 
MUDD: Shh! Calm down now, darlings. Would you mind waiting outside? 
SECURITY: Sorry, sir. 
MUDD: Well, now, answer every question they put to you. Don't lie. Well, you've no need to, have you, and don't submit to a med. That is, being so healthy, they've no need for a medical exam, have they. 
RUTH: What if they ask about 
MUDD: They won't. Have you no place to go lads? 
MAGDA: They'll notice we're different. 
MUDD: No, no, no, they won't. Just let Leo take all the hard questions. Now don't be panicking, loves. We'll get to 
EVE: Get where? We don't have a ship and we're headed the wrong way, Harry. 
NUDD: Leo. Leo Walsh is me name, darling. Don't forget that. So lovely. Lovely, aren't they? If they only think lovely thoughts, if they smile, they'll come out right some which way, won't they? My personal guarantee on that.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: The entire ship's power is feeding through one lithium crystal. 
KIRK: Well, switch to by-pass circuits. 
SCOTT: We burned them all out when we super-heated. That jackass Walsh not only wrecked his vessel, but in saving his skin 
KIRK: If it makes you feel better, Engineer, that's one jackass we're going to see skinned. 
SCOTT: But it's frustrating. Almost a million gross tons of vessel depending on a hunk of crystal the size of my fist. 
SPOCK: And that crystal won't hold up, not pulling all our power through it. 
KIRK: Well, Mister Spock? 
SPOCK: There's a lithium mining operation on Rigel 12. High-grade ore, I've heard. 
KIRK: Location and distance. 
SPOCK: Mister Farrell has the course. Less than two day's travel. 
KIRK: Make for Rigel 12, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Rigel 12, Mister Farrell. You have the course.

Captain's log, Stardate 1329.2. On board the U.S.S. Enterprise, a ship's hearing is being convened against the transport vessel's captain. I'm becoming concerned about the almost-hypnotic effect produced by the women.

[Briefing room]

KIRK: This hearing is convened. Stardate 1329.2, on board starship U.S.S. Enterprise. Formal hearings against transport captain Leo Walsh. Start computer. 
SPOCK: State your name for the record. 
MUDD: Leo Francis Walsh. 
COMPUTER: Incorrect. 
SPOCK: Your correct name. 
MUDD: Gentlemen, surely you're not going to take the word of a soulless mechanical device over that of a real flesh and blood man. 
SPOCK: State your correct name for the record. 
MUDD: Harry Mudd. 
COMPUTER: Incorrect. 
MUDD: Harcourt Fenton Mudd. 
SPOCK: Any past offenses, Mister Mudd? 
MUDD: Of course not. Gentlemen, I'm simply an honest businessman. 
COMPUTER: Incorrect. 
MUDD: Blast that tin-plated pot. 
COMPUTER: Full data coming on screen. RUTH: If it can read our minds, too. 
MUDD: It can't, darling. It can't. Just what's on the record. COMPUTER: Offense record. Smuggling. Sentence suspended. Transport of stolen goods. Purchase of space vessel with counterfeit currency. Sentences, psychiatric treatment, effectiveness disputed. 
KIRK: Mister Mudd, you're charged with galaxy travel without a flight plan, without an identification beam, and failure to answer a starship's signal, thus effecting a menace to navigation. 
MUDD: What? My tiny ship in this immense galaxy a menace to navigation? 
KIRK: You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's license. 
MUDD: Untrue! I have a master's ticket. 
COMPUTER: Incorrect. Master's license revoked Stardate 1116.4. 
MUDD: All right. Well, very simply, Leo Walsh, who was to be my captain on this trip, passed away suddenly. Well, I had no choice but to take out me ship me own self. I assumed Leo's name out of courtesy to him. In memoriam, as it were. A fine, fine man, alas, gone to his reward. 
KIRK: Destination and purpose of journey? 
MUDD: Planet Ophiuchus 3. Wiving settlers. 
KIRK: Come again, Mister Mudd. You do what? 
MUDD: I recruit wives for settlers, a difficult but satisfying task. 
KIRK: Data on witnesses. 
COMPUTER: No data. 
KIRK: Computer, go to sensor probe. Any unusual readings? 
COMPUTER: No decipherable reading on females. However, unusual reading on male board members. Detecting high respiration patterns, perspiration rate up, heartbeat rapid, blood pressure higher than normal. 
KIRK: Er, that's sufficient. Strike that from the record. 
MUDD: You see, gentlemen, just as I told you. Three lovely ladies destined for frontier planets to be the companions of lonely men, to supply that warmth of a human touch that's so desperately needed. A wife, a home, a family. Gentlemen, I look upon this work as a sacred public trust. I've devoted me whole life to it. 
COMPUTER: Incorrect. 
MUDD: Well, I'm about to start devoting my entire life to it. 
KIRK: Did these ladies come voluntarily? 
MUDD: Well, of course! Now, for example, Ruthie here comes from a pelagic planet, sea ranchers. Magda there from the helium experimental station. 
EVE: It's the same story for all of us, Captain. No men. Mine was a farm planet with automated machines for company and two brothers to cook for, mend their clothes, canal mud a foot thick on their boots every time they walked in. 
MUDD: Fine, Evie. Fine. 
EVE: It's not fine! We've got men willing to be our husbands waiting for us, and you're taking us in the opposite direction! Staring at us Iike we were Saturnius harem girls or something. 
MUDD: That's enough, Evie. 
KIRK: The only charges are against Mister Mudd. Illegal operation of a vessel. Do you have any defence to offer? 
MUDD: Only heaven's own truth, which I've just given you. 
KIRK: The hearing is closed. Mister Mudd to be handed over to the legal authorities at our earliest opportunity. 
EVE: And what about us? What happens to us? Help us, please. All of us. 
KIRK: Miss McHuron, if you don't mind 
SCOTT: Our last crystal, sir. It's gone. 
SULU: Captain Kirk, engineering section reports our entire life-support system is now on batteries. 
KIRK: Mister Spock. Miss McHuron, would you mind. Mister Spock, will you contact the miners on Rigel 12? Notify them that we'll need the lithium crystals immediately upon arrival. (all officers leave) 
MUDD: Oh, you beautiful galaxy! Oh, that heavenly universe! Well, girls, lithium miners. Don't you understand? Lonely, isolated, overworked, rich lithium miners! Girls, do you still want husbands, hmm? Evie, you won't be satisfied with a mere ship's captain. I'll get you a man who can buy you a whole planet. Maggie, you're going to be a countess. Ruth, I'll make you a duchess. And I, I'll be running this starship. Captain James Kirk, the next orders you're taking will be given by Harcourt Fenton Mudd!

Captain's log-- Stardate 1330.1. Position, fourteen hours out of Rigel 12. We're on auxiliary impulse engines. Fuel low, barely sufficient to achieve orbit over the planet. Lithium replacements are now imperative. The effect of Mudd's women on my crew continues to grow, still totally unexplained. Harry Mudd is confined to his quarters under guard.

[Sickbay]

RUTH: May I come in? 
MCCOY: Why, yes, please do. By all means. Connors, are you finished? 
RUTH: I was wondering what this place looked like. It's fascinating. 
MCCOY: Would, Would you walk past my panel again, please? 
RUTH: Your what? 
MCCOY: My medical scanner. 
RUTH: Oh, why? You're not giving me an examination, are you? 
MCCOY: Oh no. I wouldn't trust my, my judgment, believe me. Just walk by, please. (scanner heart monitor activates) It's not supposed to do that. 
RUTH: I wondered, will you be examining the miners on Rigel 12? 
MCCOY: Yes, if they need it. 
RUTH: You haven't asked yet? Are they in good health and all? 
MCCOY: What? Oh, yes, they're in excellent health, all three of them. 
RUTH: Oh. Three. 
MCCOY: Are you wearing some unusual kind of perfume or something radioactive, my dear? 
RUTH: No. I'm just me. 
MCCOY: I wonder what makes it do that.

[Kirk's quarters]

EVE: Captain? I hope you don't mind. 
KIRK: As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do. 
EVE: I was trying to take a walk, and I just, I just had to run in someplace. You see, all your men were looking at me, following me with their eyes. 
KIRK: Yes. I'll have to talk to them about that. They, er, they don't do that ordinarily, Miss McHuron, but somehow, in your case, and the ladies with you, its, er 
EVE: They're probably just lonely. I can understand loneliness. 
KIRK: Yes. Yes, er, now, Miss McHuron 
EVE: I, I suppose you understand it even more, having to run a huge ship like this with so much responsibility every minute and having to be so careful with all your men looking up to you. 
KIRK: Well, it probably appears more difficult than it is. 
EVE: Hmm! I read once that a commander has to act like a paragon of virtue. I never met a paragon. 
KIRK: Neither have I. 
EVE: Well, of course not. No one is. But some people try to pretend. Do you, Captain? 
KIRK: Miss McHuron, I don't 
EVE: Oh, no! Oh, I just can't do it. I don't care what Harry Mudd says. I do like you, but I just can't go through with it. I hate this whole thing!

[Mudds's quarters]

MUDD: Just three? You're sure? 
RUTH: Yes. The miners are healthy and fairly young. 
MUDD: Later, dear, later. Magda, did you get to your communications man? 
MAGDA: The head miner is named Ben Childress. The others are Gossett and Benton. 
MUDD: And they've been there? 
RUTH: Almost three years now, alone! 
MUDD: Perfect. Perfect. Three of them and three lovely ladies has Harry Mudd. And lithium crystals, my dear, are worth three hundred times their weight in diamonds, thousands of times their weight in gold. 
RUTH: But they'll be down there, and we'll be up here, circling a hundred miles above them. 
MAGDA: And there's a guard outside your door, Harry. You can't get out of your cabin. 
MUDD: No, my dears. After one more job for you, it won't be Harry Mudd that's trapped. It will be a gentleman named James T 
EVE: I don't like you, and I'm not very happy with myself, either. 
MUDD: Well, I'm not really surprised. I've seen you noticing the Captain. 
EVE: We're supposed to notice them! Oh, oh Harry, I don't feel very good. I think it must be near the time.

[Bridge]

KIRK: I asked for a preorbital course, Mister Farrell. 
FARRELL: Preorbital course locked in, sir. 
KIRK: That's the last time I'm giving an order twice, gentlemen. We're down to battery power, and we're low on that. 
SCOTT: It'll get us to Rigel 12, sir, but it'll be a shaky orbit. 
KIRK: Just hang us in long enough to get six crystals, Scotty. That's all we need. 
SCOTT: I'll get you there. 
KIRK: Ridiculous. What are we running here. Did you examine them? Did you examine Eve? 
MCCOY: She refused. 
KIRK: Well, come on, you're the doctor. What is it? Is it that we're tired, and they're beautiful? They are incredibly beautiful. 
MCCOY: Are they, Jim? Are they actually more lovely, pound for pound, measurement for measurement, than any other women you've known? Or is it that they just, well, act beautiful. No. Strike that, strike that. 
KIRK: What are they? 
MCCOY: You mean are they alien illusions? That sort of thing? 
KIRK: I asked you first. 
MCCOY: No, an alien smart enough to pull this could also keep my medical scanner from going beep! 
KIRK: I don't follow you. 
MCCOY: I don't either.

[Mudd's quarters]

MAGDA: Top space frequency of three nine. (hands over communicator) 
MUDD: Rigel 12. Rigel 12. 
CHILDRESS [OC]: This is Rigel 12. Come in, Enterprise. 
MUDD: Well, this isn't exactly the Enterprise. My name is Harry Mudd. To whom have I the pleasure of speaking, sir?

[Bridge]

SULU: Power curve still dropping, Captain. 
FARRELL: We'll make orbit, sir. A temporary one. 
KIRK: Lay in. Computer? 
SPOCK: We can sustain this orbit for three days, seven hours. 
KIRK: More than enough time. Communications, have a representative of the Rigel 12 miners meet us here to discuss our needs. Beam him up first pass over their camp. 
UHURA: Yes, sir.

[Mudd's quarters]

RUTH: Look what's happening. (hair lank, skin slightly lined) Look at my face. 
MAGDA: Give us the pills. 
RUTH: What if someone sees us like this? 
EVE: You'll never find them, Harry, and if you do find them you know what they are. A cheat. If you care for someone, really care 
MUDD: (ransacking drawers frantically) For whom, Evie? For Kirk? You'll find out that Ship's captains are already married, girl, to their vessels. You'd find out the first time you came between him and the ship. You'll see. 
RUTH: I'm going back to what I was. Ugly. 
MAGDA: I can't stand myself like this. 
RUTH: Why did you hide them, Harry? Don't you trust us? 
MUDD: I didn't hide them, girl. I put them in a safe place in case I was searched. 
MADGA: Find the pill, Harry! 
MUDD: Mattress! Yes, here! (Ruth and Magda devour them eagerly) Go on, Eve. Take it. It's not a cheat. It's a miracle for some man who can appreciate it and who needs it.

[Kirk's quarters]

SPOCK: Even burned and cracked, they're beautiful. Destroying them was a shame. 
KIRK: Not at all, Mister Spock. The choice was burning this lithium crystal or the destruction of another man's ship. Come. SECURITY: Sir. Mining Chief Childress and Mister Gossett. 
KIRK: Good. Show them in. I'm James Kirk, captain of the Enterprise. This is my science officer Mister Spock. 
CHILDRESS: Let's get right to business. You want lithium crystals and we've got them. 
KIRK: Fine. I'm authorised to pay an equitable price. 
CHILDRESS: We're not sure they're for sale, Captain. We might prefer a swap. 
KIRK: What did you have in mind? 
CHILDRESS: Mudd's women. 
GOSSETT: If we like them. We'd like to have a look at them first of course. 
CHILDRESS: Right. Trot them out, Captain. Oh, and Harry Mudd. Either way, I've agreed to have him released. Charges dropped. 
KIRK: (laughs) Is there anything else? 
CHILDRESS: You've got no choice, Kirk. You beam a landing party down, and you won't find one blessed crystal. 
KIRK: No deal. You're a long way out in space, gentlemen. You'll need medical help, cargo runs, starship protection. You want to consider those facts too? 
MUDD: Come along, ladies, come along. You must be Ben Childress. Come on now, girls, come on. 
RUTH: And you must be Herm Gossett. 
GOSSETT: Yes, I reckon I am. 
CHILDRESS: One thing I'll say for you, Mudd, you're not a liar. Ladies, you are welcome. 
KIRK: It's still no deal. 
SPOCK: Conserving batteries, sir. Half power. 
MUDD: I'm told they have only three days of orbit left before they start spiraling in. I do hate to see you suffering such a situation, Captain, but truth is truth, and the sad fact is you will deal. Sooner or later, you'll have to.

Captain's log. Transporting down to surface of planet Rigel 12 to acquire replacement lithium crystals. Expect further difficulty from miners.

[Miner's camp]

KIRK: All right, Childress, you've won. Now I'll take the lithium crystals. 
CHILDRESS: When I have the time, Kirk. 
KIRK: Childress. 
CHILDRESS: We're busy, Mister Kirk. 
SPOCK: We don't have the time to spare, Captain. 
KIRK: You got a better idea? 
CHILDRESS: (to Eve) Blows like that all the time. You can get lost a dozen feet from your doorstep. The wind comes up sudden. Magnetic storm. That means the wind will really rip soon. 
MAGDA: Dance with me. 
CHILDRESS: Would you like to dance? 
EVE: No, I (coughs) No. I'm sorry, I guess it must be the dust. 
CHILDRESS: That's the way it is on Rigel all the time. (cuts in on Ruth instead) 
GOSSETT: Hey. 
BENTON: Go away. 
GOSSETT: I'm cutting in. 
BENTON: Not on me. (fight starts) 
CHILDRESS: What's the matter with you? 
EVE: Why don't you run a raffle and the loser gets me? (leaves) 
CHILDRESS: You can't go out there. You'll get killed. 
KIRK: Just have those crystals here when I get back.

[Planet surface]

KIRK: Eve! Eve!

Captain's log. Have transported aboard the Enterprise to implement search with infrared scanners and sensing system. Magnetic storms on the planet's surface are cutting down speed and efficiency of our equipment. Search now in progress for three hours, eighteen minutes.

[Bridge]

FARRELL: Traverse parallel three and four. 
SULU: Checking, but not getting much. 
SPOCK: The storm is ionising the atmosphere, Captain. Getting difficult to probe through it. 
SCOTT: Captain, this is draining our batteries further. If we only had those crystals. 
KIRK: But we don't! I didn't get any. I should have found a way. Satisfied, Mister Scott? 
UHURA: Losing communications with the miners, sir. Magnetic storm seems worse. 
KIRK: Has Childress reported in yet? 
UHURA: No, sir. He and the girl are still missing. 
KIRK: Sorry, Scotty. How much power do we have left? 
SCOTT: About five hours, sir.

Captain's log. Have expended all but forty three minutes of power. Ship's condition, critical. Search now in progress seven hours, thirty one minutes. Magnetic storms are easing.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Infrared reading. Check traverse three, grid zero four zero. 
FARRELL: About eleven miles, bearing one two one from the mining company. 
SULU: That's Ben Childress' quarters. 
SPOCK: There's a heat unit operating in there. It could be a cookstove. 
KIRK: Have Mudd meet me in the transporter room. 
SPOCK: Mudd? 
KIRK: The name of this game.

[Childress' quarters]

CHILDRESS: I had things where I wanted them. 
EVE: I ate some of your food, so I paid with some chores. 
CHILDRESS: And I do my own cooking. I've not laid a hand on you. Remember that. 
EVE: Oh, the sound of male ego. You travel halfway across the galaxy, and it's still the same song. There. You going to eat or talk? 
CHILDRESS: I guess I'm supposed to sit, taste, and roll my eyes. Ooh, female cooking again. I've tasted better, by my own hand. 
EVE: Well you're tasting some of it now. I couldn't scrape three layers of your leavings out of that pan. 
CHILDRESS: You find me a well, some decent water, then talk. 
EVE: Well, why don't you hang your pan out in the wind and let the sand blast it clean, or hadn't you thought about that? 
CHILDRESS: (after hanging out the pots) It might work. That solitaire? 
EVE: Double jack. 
CHILDRESS: The red eight ought to go on the black nine. 
EVE: Not in double jack. 
CHILDRESS: You're not only plain as an old bucket, you're not even good company. What the devil happened to your looks, anyway? 
EVE: I got tired of you. I slumped. 
CHILDRESS: You heard what I said. You're homely! I've got enough in crystals already to buy queens by the gross! (Kirk and Mudd enter) I didn't touch her. 
MUDD: Thank heaven you found her. 
CHILDRESS: She's been bubbling with gratitude ever since. 
KIRK: Sit down. Tell him. Tell him, Harry. 
MUDD: Ah. Yes, well. 
KIRK: The Venus drugs, Harry. 
CHILDRESS: Venus drug? I've heard of it but, it's not just one of those stories? 
KIRK: Oh, it exists, illegally. 
MUDD: Well, actually, you see, it's a relatively harmless drug. 
EVE: Harmless! 
MUDD: Well, what it does is give you more of whatever you have. Well, with men, it makes them more muscular. Women, rounder. Men, more aggressive. Women, more feminine, and 
KIRK: He gave it to the women before you met them. 
CHILDRESS: Does that mean the others? They really look like she does? 
MUDD: Mister Childress, I 
CHILDRESS: Is that what it means? 
EVE: Yes, that's what it means! 
CHILDRESS: What happened to my partners? 
KIRK: They've left for their quarters during the storm, Childress. They're married. Subspace radio marriage. It was a fraud. They can get out of it. 
MUDD: If they want to. 
CHILDRESS: Why? 
MUDD: You can't condemn the women. 
CHILDRESS: I can! A man goes out and fights, almost dies. We all almost die. We should have, but we didn't. And now that we've got the good life in our hands, you bring us women for wives that 
EVE: You don't want wives, you want this. This is what you want, Mister Childress. I hope you remember it and dream about it, because you can't have it. It's not real! (takes the pills) Is this the kind of wife you want, Ben? Not someone to help you, not a wife to cook and sew and cry and need, but this kind. Selfish, vain, useless. Is this what you really want? All right, then. Here it is. 
KIRK: Quite a woman, eh, Childress? 
CHILDRESS: A fake, pumped up by a drug. 
KIRK: By herself. She took no drug. 
EVE: I swallowed it. 
KIRK: Coloured gelatin. 
MUDD: Yes, they took away my drug and substituted that. 
EVE: But that can't be. 
KIRK: There's only one kind of woman. 
MUDD: Or man, for that matter. 
KIRK: You either believe in yourself, or you don't. All right Childress, I've gone as far with you as I intend to. I want those lithium crystals and I want them now. Enterprise, this is Kirk. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain. 
KIRK: Stand by. Do I beam down a search party? 
CHILDRESS: No, the crystals are here, and you're welcome to them. 
KIRK: Stand by, Mister Spock. We're coming aboard with the lithium crystals. 
SPOCK [OC]: How many coming, Captain? 
CHILDRESS: Eve will stay, today at least. We, er, we want to talk. 
KIRK: Eve? 
EVE: You've got someone up there called the Enterprise. 
KIRK: Two of us, Mister Spock. Come on, Mister Mudd. 
MUDD: Don't you think you could possibly, by accident, arrange to leave me behind here? On this planet that would be punishment enough. 
KIRK: I can't do that, Harry, but I will appear as a character witness at your trial. If you think that'll help. 
MUDD: They'll throw away the key.

[Bridge]

MCCOY: That must have been quite a talk you made down there. Ever try considering the patent medicine business? 
KIRK: Why should I work your side of the street? 
SPOCK: I'm happy the affair is over. A most annoying emotional episode. 
MCCOY: Smack right in the old heart. Oh, I'm sorry. In your case, it would be about here. 
SPOCK: The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours, Doctor, pleases me no end. 
FARRELL: Course plotted and all systems in operation. 
SULU: Engines engaged. Helm answering. 
FARRELL: Out of orbit, sir. 
KIRK: Ahead full. 
SULU: Ahead full, sir.

CHAPEL: Roger's a very determined man. He'd find a way to live. 
UHURA: Beginning signals to surface, sir. 
KIRK: Put it on all frequencies, Lieutenant. 
SPOCK: Ship's record banks show little we don't already know about this planet, Captain. Gravity is one point one of Earth, atmosphere within safety limits.
KIRK: But the surface temperature of that planet is one hundred degrees below zero. 
SPOCK: It may have been inhabited once, but the sun in this system has been fading steadily for a half million years. Now, Doctor Korby, often called the Pasteur of archaeological medicine. His translation of medical records from the Orion ruins revolutionised our immunisation techniques. 
KIRK: Required reading at the academy, Mister Spock. I've always wanted to meet him. Do you think there's any chance of him still being alive? 
UHURA: I've tried all frequencies, sir. No return signal. 
KIRK: Keep trying. 
CREWMAN [OC]: Warp capacity point zero seven and building. 
CREWMAN 2 [OC]: Communicator, we need more lines to the impulse deck.
CHAPEL: His last signal told about finding underground caverns. 
KIRK: And since then two expeditions have failed to find him.

KIRK: Enterprise to Korby. We have your co-ordinates pin-pointed. We're preparing to beam down a party. It may interest you that we have aboard this vessel 
KORBY [OC]: I've a rather unusual request, Captain Kirk. Beam down alone, just yourself. We've made discoveries of such a nature they may require an extraordinary decision from you. 
SPOCK: That's an unusual request. 
KIRK: The man making it is Doctor Roger Korby. 
SPOCK: You're certain you recognise his voice? 
CHAPEL: Have you ever been engaged, Mister Spock? Yes, it's Roger. 
KIRK: Agreed, Doctor. However, there will be two of us. 
CHAPEL: Hello, Roger.
KORBY [OC]: Christine! 
CHAPEL: Yes, Roger. 
KORBY [OC]: Darling, how, Where are you? Yes, yes, by all means, Captain. I, I had no idea, no hope. Darling, are you all right?

CHAPEL: He said he'd be waiting. KIRK: Doctor Korby? Doctor Korby. It's possible we may have hit the wrong entry point. Kirk to Enterprise. 
SPOCK [OC]: Spock here, Captain.
KIRK: Beam down two security men. 
SPOCK [OC]: Any problems, Captain? 
KIRK: Some delay in meeting us. Probably nothing at all. Kirk out. Corridors could be quite deep. Getting here may have taken more time than he estimated. Don't worry. 
CHAPEL: Thank you. 
KIRK: Rayburn, maintain post here. 
RAYBURN: Yes, sir. 
KIRK: Matthews, we'll look for Doctor Korby. Accompany us. 
MATTHEWS: Yes, sir.

[Tunnels]

(the trio go deeper into the tunnel complex, until Chapel slips at the edge of a deep pit. Further on they come to a bright light. A figure steps in front of it) 
KIRK: Is that you, Doctor Korby? 
CHAPEL: Doctor Brown! It's Roger's assistant. Brownie, where's Roger? 
(a man screams, they dash back to the pit. A figure is creeping away, unseen) 
BROWN: Be careful. 
KIRK: Is there a path down there? 
BROWN: There's no hope, Captain. It's bottomless. He must have slipped. 
KIRK: Any chance of a projection or a ledge? 
BROWN: None, Captain. Unfortunate. Terribly unfortunate. Doctor Korby was detained. I came as soon as I could. 
KIRK: Not soon enough. 
CHAPEL: Brownie, what is it? 
BROWN: Explain. 
CHAPEL: Don't you recognise me? 
BROWN: Christine. You look well. My name is Brown, Doctor Korby's assistant. I presume you are Captain Kirk. He's dead, I assure you. Come, Doctor Korby will be waiting. 
KIRK: You do know him well? An old friend? 
CHAPEL: I suppose living here for five years. 
KIRK: Captain Kirk to Rayburn. Report. 
RAYBURN [OC]: All quiet here at the entry, Captain.

[Tunnel entrance]

RAYBURN: Any problems there, sir? 
KIRK [OC]: We lost Matthews. Apparently an accident. Tell the Enterprise to have a full security party standing by. 
RAYBURN: Yes, sir. 
KIRK [OC]: And we'll both report in at hourly intervals. If you and I lose contact, or if he fails to hear from either of us, he's to beam the security party down immediately. Kirk out. 
(the figure creeps up on Rayburn and attacks him)

[Tunnels]

BROWN: Doctor Korby has discovered that as their sun dimmed, the inhabitants of this planet moved underground from an open environment to this dark world. When you were a student of his, Christine, you must have often heard Doctor Korby remark how freedom of movement and choice produced the human spirit. The culture of Exo 3 proved his theory. When they moved from light to darkness, they replaced freedom with a mechanistic culture. Doctor Korby has been able to uncover elements of this culture which will revolutionise the universe when freed from this cavernous environment.

[Korby's study]

ANDREA: I'm Andrea. You must be Christine. I've always thought how beautiful your name is. And you must be Captain Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. We appreciate you bringing Roger's fiancee to him. 
CHAPEL: I don't remember Doctor Korby mentioning an Andrea. 
ANDREA: But you are exactly as Roger described you. No wonder he missed you so. 
KIRK: Where is Doctor Korby? 
KORBY: Here, Captain. I, I've been looking forward to (sees Chapel, and they kiss) 
CHAPEL: Oh, I knew I'd find you. 
KORBY: Everything's all right now. Oh, forgive me, Captain. I'm, er, I'm Roger Korby. 
KIRK: There's no need to apologise, sir, and certainly no need to introduce yourself. 
BROWN: The captain lost a man in the caverns, Doctor. 
KORBY: What? How did it happen? 
BROWN: The pit near the outer junction. The edge must have given way. 
KORBY: I'm terribly sorry, Captain. Perhaps if I'd been there. I know the passages so well. 
KIRK: It wasn't your fault. Kirk to Rayburn, report. I'm required to make a security confirmation. When I call my ship, if you list your personnel, cargo requirements, any special needs 
KORBY: Captain, I'd much prefer 
KIRK: Rayburn, are you receiving? 
KORBY: I'd prefer you waited, Captain, please, till I've talked to you. 
KIRK: I've lost contact with my guard. I'm required to call my ship. 
BROWN: No communications, Captain. (holding weapon) 
CHAPEL: Roger. 
KORBY: I'm sorry. If they should send down more people, 
CHAPEL: Roger, that 
KORBY: He won't be harmed. I promise you. Isn't it possible there could be things here unknown to you, so terribly important 
KIRK: Sir, one man is dead. I've lost contact with the other. 
KORBY: Andrea. 
KIRK: What are you doing? 
KORBY: This is necessary, Captain. You will understand. Andrea. (she reaches for Kirk's phaser, but he grabs her to use as a shield and aims it at Brown instead, while moving towards a table to use as a barrier instead of the girl) 
KIRK: Drop it! (he fires, Brown falls straight backwards and the big figure bursts in and lifts Kirk off his feet. Chapel screams as she sees the hole in Brown reveals electronic parts)

[Bridge]

KIRK [OC]: Enterprise from Captain Kirk. Come in. Do you read? 
UHURA: Frequency open, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Spock here, Captain. 
KIRK [OC]: Contact established with Doctor Korby. 
SPOCK: We were becoming concerned, Captain. Your check-in was overdue and since we'd not heard from your security team 
KIRK [OC]: No problem, Mister Spock. Bear with me.

[Korby's study]

RUK [Kirk's voice]: We'll return to the ship within forty eight hours. Doctor Korby's records and specimens will require careful packing.

[Bridge]

SPOCK: Captain, are you all right? You sound tired.

[korby's study]

KORBY: If you move or cry out, Ruk may injure you. At least wait until we can talk. 
SPOCK [OC]: Acknowledge, Captain. Is everything all right? 
RUK [Kirk's voice]: Fine, Mister Spock. Doctor Korby has made some fascinating discoveries. All under control. Stand by for regular contact. Kirk out. 
KORBY: This is not a vain display, Captain. I'm a scientist. You obviously know my reputation. Trust me. 
KIRK: Yes, I know your reputation. The whole galaxy knows who you are and what you stand for. That's why all this makes no sense. 
KORBY: There's so much you must learn Before you make a final judgment. For example (to Ruk) Andrea. 
RUK [Andrea's Voice]: You must be Captain Kirk of the Starship Enterprise. [Korby's Voice] Christine, it's all right now. 
KORBY: You see, Captain? 
RUK [Christine's Voice]: Yes Roger, everything is all right now. 
KORBY: That's enough. You are not to mock Christine. You will never harm her. 
KIRK: Or disobey an order from her. 
KORBY: You will not disobey her orders. Satisfied, Captain Kirk? Both love and trust. Now, give me twenty four hours to convince you. 
KIRK: Doctor, do I need to be a prisoner to be convinced? 
KORBY: What would your first duty be upon return to your vessel? Report! Do you realise the number of discoveries lost because of superstition, of ignorance, of a layman's inability to comprehend? 
KIRK: A simple layman's question, Doctor. Where is my other crewman? Alive? Dead? 
KORBY: Ruk was programmed to protect my experiments. The logic of his machine mind saw danger to me. 
KIRK: Where is my other crewman? 
KORBY: Ruk destroyed them both, totally against my wishes I assure you. 
KIRK: He's an android like Brown? 
RUK: More complex than Brown. Much superior. I was left here by the old ones. 
KORBY: Ruk was still tending the machinery when we arrived here. How many centuries? Even Ruk doesn't know. With his help, ith the records I could find, we built Brown. 
KIRK: You've convinced me, Doctor. You've convinced me that you're dangerous. (makes a run for it but Ruk grabs him and throws him around) 
KORBY: Ruk, no!

[Dining room]

ANDREA: I do not understand. Why are you unhappy? You are with Roger again. 
CHAPEL: Where is Captain Kirk? 
ANDREA: You are concerned about the captain?
CHAPEL: Yes, I am concerned.
ANDREA: How can you love Roger without trusting him? Why does it bother you when I use the name Roger?
KORBY: Andrea, it's sufficient that it does disturb her. You will call me Doctor Korby from now on, Andrea.
ANDREA: Yes, Doctor Korby. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, darling. As you can see, Captain Kirk is fine. He won't be harmed. The things at stake here simply make it necessary he doesn't send a report to his ship. I need time to explain and demonstrate to him and to you. Now shall we start with Andrea?
CHAPEL: Yes, let's start with Andrea.
ANDREA: I'm like Doctor Brown, an android. Didn't you know?
KORBY: Remarkable, isn't she? Notice the the lifelike pigmentation, the variation in skin tones. The flesh, the flesh has warmth. There's even a pulse, physical sensation.
CHAPEL: How convenient.
KORBY: Christine, you must realise an android's like a computer. It does only what I programme. As a trained scientist yourself, you must realise that 
CHAPEL: Given a mechanical Doctor Brown, a mechanical geisha would be no more difficult.
KORBY: You think I could love a machine?
CHAPEL: Did you?
KORBY: Andrea's incapable of that. She simply obeys orders. She has no meaning for me. There's no emotional bond. Andrea, kiss Captain Kirk. Now strike him. You see? There's no emotion in it, no emotional involvement. She simply responds to orders. She's a totally logical computer. A thing is not a woman. Now do you understand? 
KIRK: If these mechanical things have no feelings and perform only as you programme them, then why did Brown try to shoot me? Why did he kill two of my men? There are many things I don't understand, Doctor.
KORBY: I will answer all of your questions now.

[Laboratory]

KORBY: This is how you make an android. (Kirk is naked on one side of circular table, a human-shaped blob on the other) Andrea. (the table starts turning) He's not being harmed, I promise. 
CHAPEL: Roger, what's happened to you? When I sat in your class, you wouldn't even dream of harming an insect or an animal. Their life was sacred to you then. 
KORBY: Christine, if I'd simply beamed up to their vessel with Brown and the others, I'd have given them objects of curiosity, beginnings of wild stories, foolish theories. Ruk! Watch carefully. (the blob turns into Kirk, and the table is stopped) Choose, Christine. Which is your captain? 
CHAPEL: I don't know. They're exact. I honestly don't know. 
KORBY: Synthetic organs are in place. We merely synchronise them with Kirk's autonomic nervous system, duplicating the rhythms of his body. At the same time, we duplicate the mental pattern. Now, physical pattern complete, we now make a mental pattern. Ready for final synaptic fusion. Andrea, stand by for cortex circuits. The android will be so perfect It could even replace the captain. The same memories, the same attitudes, the same abilities. Activate circuits. 
KIRK: Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed interference, do you hear? Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed (passes out, the other one wakes up) 
KORBY: Complete. 
CHAPEL: Are you all right? 
KIRK: As far as I know. 
KORBY: Now, meet an android. 
KIRK2: How do you do, Miss Chapel?

[Dining room]

ANDREA: I am now programmed to please you also. Is the food appealing?
CHAPEL: Yes, thank you.
ANDREA: Please sit, Captain. 
KIRK2: Thank you. I'm more or less on parole, I understand.
ANDREA: Doctor Korby suggested that you have lunch. He thought you might have a few things to talk about.
CHAPEL: Captain. 
KIRK2: I know, I know. I'd hate to be torn between commander and fiance myself.
CHAPEL: No, I'm not torn. I'm puzzled. I'm worried. 
KIRK2: Has he confided in you? 
CHAPEL: Nothing he hasn't told you. I know it doesn't make sense. What he's done may seem wrong, but he is Roger Korby, whatever he seems to be doing. 
KIRK2: Unless something's gone wrong with his mind. 
CHAPEL: No. You're forgetting how well I know him. He's as sane as you or I. 
KIRK2: Nurse, if I gave you a direct order to betray him 
CHAPEL: Please, don't ask me to make that choice. I'd much rather you push me off the same precipice where Matthews died. Oh, I can't. (pushes plate away) Please, go ahead and eat. 
KIRK2: Androids don't eat, Miss Chapel. 
KORBY: He even has your sense of humour. 
KIRK: Well, there's one difference between us. I'm hungry. 
KIRK2: The difference is your weakness, Captain, not mine. 
KORBY: One at a time, gentlemen. Captain? 
KIRK: Eating is a pleasure, sir. Unfortunately, one you will never know. 
KIRK2: Perhaps, but I will never starve, sir. 
KIRK: He's an exact duplicate? 
KORBY: In every detail. 
KIRK: What about memory? Tell me about Sam. 
KIRK2: George Samuel Kirk, your brother. Only you call him Sam. 
KIRK: He saw me off on this mission. 
KIRK2: Yes, with his wife and three sons. 
KIRK: He said he was being transferred to Earth colony two research station. 
KIRK2: No, Captain. He said he was continuing his research and that he wanted to be transferred to Earth colony two. 
KORBY: You might as well try to outthink a calculating machine. 
KIRK: Obviously, I can't, but we do have some interesting differences. 
KORBY: Totally unimportant ones. You may leave now. (Kirk2 leaves) You haven't guessed the rest? Not even you, Christine? What you saw was only a machine, Only half of what I could've accomplished, Do you understand? By continuing the process I could've transferred you, your very consciousness into that android. Your soul, if you wish. All of you. In android form, a human being can have practical immortality. Can you understand what I'm offering mankind? 
KIRK: Programming. Different word, but the same old promises made by Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis. 
KORBY: Can you understand that a human converted to an android can be programmed for the better? Can you imagine how life could be improved if we could do away with jealousy, greed, hate? 
KIRK: It can also be improved by eliminating love, tenderness, sentiment. The other side of the coin, Doctor. 
KORBY: No one need ever die again. No disease, no deformities. why even fear can be programmed away, replaced with joy. I'm offering you a pracical heaven, a new paradise, and all I need is your help. 
KIRK: All you wanted before was my understanding. 
KORBY: I need transportation to a planet colony with proper raw materials. I'm sure there are several good possibilities among your next stops. No diversion from your route. I want no suspicions aroused. I'll begin producing androids carefully, selectively. 
KIRK: Yes, yes. No one need know, only to frighten uninformed minds. 
KORBY: They must be strongly infiltrated into society before the android existence is revealed. I want no wave of hysteria to destroy what is good and right. You with me, Captain? 
KIRK: You've created your own Kirk. Why do you need me? 
KORBY: I created him to impress you, not to replace you. 
KIRK: I'm impressed, Doctor, but not the way you think! (leaps up with cord he's untied from the chair leg and loops it around Korby's throat) Stand back, Ruk! I'll kill him! Stay back. (goes through door, releasing Korby into Ruk's arms) 
KORBY: Ruk, protect! 
CHAPEL: Roger, I. Ruk, no! (runs after him)

[Tunnels]

CHAPEL: Ruk, stop! Doctor Korby said you are to obey me! Ruk! Ruk! Ruk, I order you not to harm him!

(Kirk breaks off a stalactite to use as a club. RUk hears the sound) 
RUK [Chapel's Voice]: Captain Kirk, where are you? Captain Kirk! I can help you! 
KIRK: Christine, is that you? 
(Ruk sneaks up and they struggle, ending up with Kirk dangling from the edge of the pit. After thinking about it, Ruk pulls him up to safety)

[Corridor]

SPOCK: Captain!

[Bedroom]

SPOCK: Captain, We finished ahead of schedule. 
KIRK2: Doctor Korby has considerable cargo to beam aboard. I'll have to go over our destination schedule with him. 
SPOCK: You're going back down with the command pack? 
KIRK2: Mind your own business, Mister Spock. I'm sick of your half-breed interference, do you hear? 
SPOCK: Yes. very well, Captain. 
KIRK2: You look upset, Mister Spock. Is everything all right up here? 
SPOCK: No problems here, sir. 
KIRK2: Good. I'll beam up shortly with Doctor Korby and party. (leaves) 
SPOCK: Security, Spock here. Status of your landing party? 
SECURITY [OC]: Ready and standing by, sir, 
SPOCK: Have them meet me in the transporter room after the Captain has beamed down.

[Korby's study]

KIRK2: I looked it over. I think you'll find planet Midas Five an excellent choice. 
KORBY: A small colony. Abundant raw materials. You made a good beginning, Captain. 
KIRK2: Thank you. I felt quite at home on the Enterprise.

[Bedroom]

KIRK: Andrea, kiss me. (she does, then raises her arm to slap him. He stops her and pulls her in for a passionate embrace)
ANDREA: No. Not programmed for you.
KIRK: What's the matter, Andrea? Confused? 
ANDREA: No. (leaves. Ruk blocks Kirk's attempt to leave) 
KIRK: Emotion, Ruk? You disapprove of Miss Chapel's orders to save my life? 
RUK: To maintain your existence would be illogical.
KIRK: Why? Can't your memory banks solve a simple equation like that? What happened to the old ones, Ruk? 
RUK: So long ago. 
KIRK: Is it possible they built their machines too well, gave them pride and a desire to survive? Machines that wanted logic and order and found that frustrated by the illogical emotional creatures that built them? 
RUK: Yes, the old ones. The ones who made us. They grew fearful of us. They began to turn us off. 
KIRK: And isn't it Korby who's creating the same danger to you all over again? Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that logic cannot solve. 
RUK: Yes. Yes, it had been so long ago, I had forgotten. The old ones here. The ones who made us, yes. Yes, it is still in my memory banks. It became necessary to destroy them. You are inconsistent. You cannot be programmed. You are inferior. 
KIRK: And Korby?
RUK: You came from the outside. You bring disorder here. 
KIRK: The danger to you is Korby. 
RUK: I was programmed by Korby. I cannot harm him. 
KIRK: The old ones programmed you, too, but it became possible to destroy them.
RUK: That was the equation! (seizes Kirk) Existence! Survival must cancel out programming.
KIRK: That's it, Ruk! Logic! You can't protect someone who's trying to destroy you! 
KORBY: Ruk, I would like 
RUK: You brought him among us. You brought the inferior ones. We had cleansed ourselves of them. Now you bring the evil back!
KORBY: Ruk, stop! Your programming. (fires phaser, Ruk vanishes) I had no choice.

[Corridor]

KIRK: You were a man with respect for all things alive. How can I explain the change in you? If I was to tell Earth I was in your hands, to tell them what has become (jumps Korby and traps his arm in a door. The skin tears to reveal electronics)

[Korby's study]

KORBY: It's still me, Christine. Roger. I'm in here. You can't imagine how it was. I was frozen, dying. My legs were gone. I was, I had only my brain between life and death. This can be repaired easier than another man can set a broken finger. I'm still the same as I was before, Christine, perhaps even better.
CHAPEL: Are you, Roger? 
KORBY: (into comm. unit) Andrea.
ANDREA [OC]: Yes, Doctor. 
KORBY: There's someone in the outer junction. 
KIRK: Spock. He must've got my message. 
ANDREA [OC]: I will find Ruk. 
CHAPEL: But he'll never find us in this maze. 
KORBY: Ruk has been shut off.

[Laboratory]

KORBY [OC]: Get a weapon. Deal with it. Protect.

[Corridor outside laboratory]

ANDREA: I will kiss you.
KIRK2: No. 
ANDREA: You, you will not?
KIRK2: It is illogical. (she disintegrates him)

[Korby's study]

KORBY: I'm the same! A direct transfer. All of me, human, rational, and without a flaw. 
ANDREA: He freed himself, and I destroyed, (sees Kirk there) destroyed him. I am not programmed for alarms. I listened to your instructions. They were mis-stated. 
KIRK: She killed the android, Korby, the same way you killed Ruk. Is this your perfect world, your flawless beings killing off one another? Aren't you doing exactly what you hate most in humans, killing with no more concern than when you turn off a light? 
KORBY: I'm not a computer. Test me. Ask me to solve any, equate, transmit. Christine, Christine, let me prove myself. Does this make such a difference?
CHAPEL: Don't you see, Roger? Everything you've done has proved it isn't you.
KORBY: I am Roger Korby!
KIRK: Then prove it. Give me that phaser gun. If there's any human left in you, give it to me.
KORBY: No. You will never understand. I constructed a perfect being, tested it, proved it. Proved it. Proved it? (hands phaser to Kirk) 
KIRK: Andrea, give me the weapon.
ANDREA: No. Protect. Protect. (to Korby) To love you. To, to kiss you. 
KORBY: No. You cannot love. You're not human.
ANDREA: Love you. Kiss. (Korby reaches for trigger and disintegrates them both)
SPOCK [OC}: Captain Kirk! 
KIRK: In here, Spock.
SPOCK: Captain, are you all right? Nurse? Where's Doctor Korby?
KIRK: Doctor Korby was never here.

[Bridge]

CHAPEL: Thank you for letting me make the decision, Captain. I'm quite certain I'm doing the right thing. (leaves) 
KIRK: She's staying with the ship. Something bothering you, Mister Spock?
SPOCK: Frankly, I was rather dismayed by your use of the term half-breed, Captain. You must admit it is an unsophisticated expression. 
KIRK: I'll remember that Mister Spock, the next time I find myself in a similar situation. Steady as we go, helm.

[Bridge]

SPINELLI: Coming up on it fast, sir. 
KIRK: Are you certain of your sensor readings? 
SPOCK: Definitely a space vessel of some type. 
KIRK: Origin? 
SPOCK: Unknown. It could hardly be an Earth ship. There have been no flights into this sector for years. 
UHURA: I'm picking up a signal, sir. (a series of beeps comes over the speakers) Captain, that's the old Morse code call signal. 
KIRK: Thank you. 
UHURA: CQ. CQ. 
KIRK: We're reading it, Lieutenant. I thought you said it couldn't possibly be an Earth vessel. 
SPOCK: I fail to understand why it always gives you pleasure to see me proven wrong. 
KIRK: An emotional Earth weakness of mine. There it is. 
(The ship appears on the viewscreen.) 
KIRK: An old Earth vessel, similar to the DY=500 class. 
SPOCK: Much older. DY-100 class, to be exact. Captain, the last such vessel was built centuries ago, back in the 1990s. 
KIRK: Then it's a derelict, its signal left on automatic. 
SPOCK: Or an old Earth ship being used by aliens. 
KIRK: Weapons status. 
WEAPONS [OC]: Deflector shields on maximum. Phasers manned, sir. 
KIRK: Bioscanners report. 
MCCOY [OC]: Life science bioscanners are picking up heart beats from over there. Can't be human, though. They're too faint, and average only four beats per minute. 
SPOCK: Sensor reading, Captain. Some sort of equipment functioning on that vessel. 
KIRK: All decks go to full alert. 
(Enterprise comes alongside the smaller ship, which is still as big as the engineering hull.

Captain's log, stardate 3141.9. A full hour has elapsed since interception of the strange vessel. Our presence alongside is still being completely ignored. Although our sensors continue to show signs of equipment and life aboard, there has been no indication of danger to us.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Weapons department, maintain battle stations. All other decks standby alert. 
UHURA: All decks acknowledging, sir. 
MCCOY: We're continuing to pick up some form of heart action over there. Very faint, very slow. Seems to be coming from about sixty or seventy bodies, as near as I can tell. 
KIRK: Alien bodies, Bones? 
MCCOY: Could be. There's no sign of breathing or other form of respiration. 
SPOCK: Hull surface is pitted with meteor scars. However, scanners make out a name. SS Botany Bay. 
KIRK: Then you can check the registry. 
SPOCK: No such vessel listed. Records of that period are fragmentary, however. The mid=1990s was the era of your last so-called World War. 
MCCOY: The Eugenics Wars. 
SPOCK: Of course. Your attempt to improve the race through selective breeding. 
MCCOY: Now, wait a minute. Not our attempt, Mister Spock. A group of ambitious scientists. I'm sure you know the type. Devoted to logic, completely unemotional 
KIRK: All right, all right, gentlemen. As you were. Rig for tractor beam, Helm. Lock onto that vessel. 
SPINELLI: Rigging for tractor beam, sir. 
KIRK: The Bridge is yours, Mister Spock. Care to join the landing party, Doctor? 
MCCOY: Well, if you're actually giving me a choice 
KIRK: I'm not. Oh, I'll need somebody familiar with the late 20th-Century Earth. Here's a chance for that historian to do something for a change. What's her name? McIvers? 
SPOCK: Lieutenant McGivers.

[McGiver's quarters]

(Lt McGivers is just about to settle down to some painting, when) 
SPOCK [OC]: Attention. The following personnel report to transporter room. Engineering Officer Scott, Lieutenant McGivers. Acknowledge. 
MARLA: McGivers. On my way.

[Transporter room]

SCOTT: Well, it looks like that ship was expecting us. We read heat coming on, complete oxygen atmosphere. 
KIRK: Very interesting. You ready, Bones? MCCOY: No. I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine, not to have my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget. 
KIRK: You're an old-fashioned boy, McCoy. Where's that historian? (McGivers enters) Come on, Lieutenant 
MARLA: McGivers, sir. 
KIRK: Energise.

[SS Botany Bay]

(Men and women are lying in clear-sided compartments, seemingly asleep.) KIRK: Scotty? 
SCOTT: Definitely Earth-type mechanism, sir. Twentieth century vessel. Old type atomic power. Bulky, solid. I think they used to call them transistor units. I'd love to tear this baby apart. 
MARLA: Captain, it's a sleeper ship. 
KIRK: Suspended animation. 
MARLA: I've seen old photographs of this. Necessary because of the time involved in space travel until about the year 2018. It took years just to travel from one planet to another. 
KIRK: Is it possible they're still alive after centuries of travel? 
MCCOY: It's theoretically possible. I've never heard of it being tested for this long a period. 
MARLA: What a handsome group of people. 
MCCOY: Jim, I have a new reading. The lights must have triggered some mechanism. 
MARLA: Captain, look here. 
(They go to the compartment holding a dark-haired man.) 
KIRK: Scotty? 
SCOTT: Beats me what's happening. 
MCCOY: We've triggered something, all right. His heart beat's increasing. Now passing eight beats per minute. There are some signs of respiration beginning. 
SCOTT: This one was probably programmed to be triggered first. 
KIRK: Could he be the leader? The leader. Lieutenant? 
MARLA: (dragging herself back from just gazing at the man) Yes, sir. The leader was often set to revive first. This would allow him to decide whether the conditions warranted revival of the others. 
MCCOY: Heart beat now approaching forty per minute. The respiration pattern is firming up. 
MARLA: From the northern India area, I'd guess. Probably a Sikh. They were the most fantastic warriors. 
MCCOY: Heart beat now fifty two and increasing. 
KIRK: The others? 
SCOTT: There's no change, and they're mixed types. Western, mid-European, Latin, Oriental. 
MARLA: A man from the twentieth century coming alive. 
MCCOY: Maybe. Heart beat dropping. 
KIRK: Circuit shorting. 
SCOTT: Probably some dust. 
MCCOY: Heartbeat now thirty, dropping fast. It's a heart flutter. He's dying. 
MARLA: Do something, Captain. 
KIRK: Can we? 
SCOTT: It'd take an hour to figure it out. 
KIRK: What happens if we get him out of there? 
MCCOY: He'll die in seconds if we don't. 
(Kirk uses something metal in his hand to break the glass and open the compartment. The man is slid out on a trolley, gasping and awake. He tries to speak.) 
KHAN: How long? 
KIRK: How long have you been sleeping? Two centuries we estimate. Landing party to Enterprise. Come in. 
UHURA: Go ahead, boarding party. We read you. 
KIRK: Lock in on McCoy's beam. He's transporting back with a casualty we discovered here. 
MARLA: Magnificent.

Captain's log, supplemental. Alongside the SS Botany Bay for ten hours now. A boarding party of engineering and medical specialists are now completing their examination of the mysterious vessel. Attempts to revive other sleepers await our success or failure with the casualty already beamed over. Doctor McCoy is frankly amazed at his physical and recuperative power.

[Bridge]

KIRK: Kirk to boarding party. 
SCOTT [OC]: Scott here. 
KIRK: Scotty, any records, log books of any kind?

[SS Botany Bay]

SCOTT: Negative, Captain. It appears they were in suspended animation when the ship took off.

KIRK: How many alive? 
SCOTT [OC]: Twelve units have malfunctioned, leaving seventy two still operating. Thirty of those are women. 
KIRK: Kirk out. Seventy two alive. A group of people dating back to the 1990s. A discovery of some importance, Mister Spock. There are a great many unanswered questions about those years. 
SPOCK: A strange, violent period in your history. I find no record what so ever of an SS Botany Bay. Captain, the DY-100 class vessel was designed for interplanetary travel only. With simple nuclear-powered engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time. It was ten thousand to one against their making it to another star system. And why no record of the trip? 
KIRK: Botany Bay. That was the name of a penal colony on shores of Australia, wasn't it? If they took that name for their vessel 
SPOCK: If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've arrived at a totally illogical conclusion. 
KIRK: Oh? 
SPOCK: Your Earth was on the verge of a dark ages. Whole populations were being bombed out of existence. A group of criminals could have been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most advanced spaceships. 
KIRK: Yes. So much for my theory. I'm still waiting to hear yours. 
SPOCK: Even a theory requires some facts, Captain. So far I have none. 
KIRK: And that irritates you, Mister Spock. 
SPOCK: Irritation? 
KIRK: Yeah. 
SPOCK: I am not capable of that emotion. 
KIRK: My apologies, Mister Spock. You suspect some danger in them? 
SPOCK: Insufficient facts always invites danger, Captain. 
KIRK: Well, we'd better get some facts. Rig for towing. 
SPINELLI: Aye, aye, sir. 
KIRK: Make course for Starbase Twelve. 
SPOCK: Aye, sir.

[Sickbay - medical ward]

(At Khan's bedside) 
MCCOY: (to nurse) That'll be all. (she leaves) 
KIRK: Bones? 
MCCOY: He'll live. 
KIRK: My compliments. 
MCCOY: No, I'm good, but not that good. There's something inside this man that refuses to accept death. Look at that. Even as he is now, his heart valve action has twice the power of yours and mine. Lung efficiency is fifty percent better. 
(McGivers enters) 
KIRK: An improved breed of human. That's what the Eugenics War was all about. 
MCCOY: I'd estimate he could lift us both with one arm. It will be interesting to see if his brain matches his body. 
MARLA: Doctor, will he live? 
MCCOY: It appears he will, Lieutenant. (leaves) 
KIRK: I'd like to talk to you. 
(They go out into the main area, where McCoy is at his desk) 
KIRK: If I were to rate your performance as a member of the landing party today I 
MARLA: I know, sir. I'm sorry. 
KIRK: Lieutenant, at any one time, the safety of this entire vessel might depend upon the performance of a single crewman, and the fact that you find a man strangely compelling to you personally 
MARLA: Not personally, Captain. Professionally. My profession is historian, and when I find a specimen from the past alive, I'm in the sheer delight of examining his mind. 
KIRK: And men were more adventuresome then. Bolder, more colourful. 
MARLA: Yes, sir, I think they were. 
KIRK: Good. If I can have honesty, it's easier to overlook mistakes. That's all. 
MARLA: Yes, sir. 
(She leaves) 
MCCOY: A pity you wasted your life on command, Jim. You'd have made a fair psychologist. 
KIRK: Fair? (leaves) 
(In the ward, Khan wakes, gets out of bed and does some stretches. He hears McCoy's voice.) 
MCCOY: Sickbay to lab. Anything new on those bios? 
LAB TECH [OC]: They all came out fine, Doctor. 
MCCOY: Good. McCoy out. 
(Khan sees a display of old medical instruments on the wall, takes a scalpel, and is back in bed when McCoy walks in to check on him. As the good doctor leans over, Khan grabs him by the throat and holds the blade to his neck.) 
MCCOY: Well, either choke me or cut my throat. Make up your mind. 
KHAN: English. I thought I dreamed hearing it. Where am I? 
MCCOY: You're in (a squeeze makes him lower his voice) You're in bed, holding a knife at your doctor's throat. 
KHAN: Answer my question. 
MCCOY: It would be most effective if you would cut the carotid artery, just under the left ear. 
(Khan releases him.) 
KHAN: I like a brave man. 
MCCOY: I was simply trying to avoid an argument. (takes the scalpel) You're aboard the United Spaceship Enterprise. Your vessel is in tow. 
KHAN: I remember a voice. Did I hear it say I had been sleeping for two centuries? 
MCCOY: That is correct. 
KHAN: Where is your Captain? I have many questions. 
(McCoy goes to the intercom) 
KIRK [OC]: Bridge. 
MCCOY: I have a patient here with many questions, Captain. 
KIRK [OC]: On my way. 
(A little later, and Khan is sitting up more) 
KIRK: James Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise. 
KHAN: I see. 
KIRK: And your name? 
KHAN: I have a few questions first. What is your heading? 
KIRK: Our heading is Starbase Twelve, a planet in the Gamma 400 star system. Our command base in this sector. Is that of any use to you? 
KHAN: And my people? 
KIRK: Seventy two of your life-support canisters are still functioning. 
KHAN: You will revive them. 
KIRK: As soon as we reach Starbase Twelve. 
KHAN: I see. 
KIRK: And now 
KHAN: Khan is my name. 
KIRK: Khan. Nothing else? 
KHAN: Khan. 
KIRK: What was the exact date of your lift off? We know it was sometime in the early 1990s, but 
KHAN: I find myself growing fatigued, Doctor. May we continue this questioning at some other time? 
KIRK: The facts I need, Mister Khan, will take very little time. For example, the nature of your expedition. 
MCCOY: Jim. A little later might be better. 
KHAN: Captain, I wonder if I could have something to read during my convalescence. I was once an engineer of sorts. I would be most interested in studying the technical manuals on your vessel. 
KIRK: Yes, I understand. You have two hundred years of catching up to do. 
KHAN: Precisely. 
KIRK: They're available to any patient on the viewing screen. Doctor McCoy will show you how to tie into the library tapes. 
KHAN: Thank you, Captain. You are very co-operative.

[Bridge]

KIRK: This Khan is not what I expected of a twentieth century man. 
SPOCK: I note he's making considerable use of our technical library. 
KIRK: Common courtesy, Mister Spock. He'll spend the rest of his days in our time. It's only decent to help him catch up. Would you estimate him to be a product of selective breeding? 
SPOCK: There is that possibility, Captain. His age would be correct. In 1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over forty nations. 
KIRK: Well, they were hardly supermen. They were aggressive, arrogant. They began to battle among themselves. 
SPOCK: Because the scientists overlooked one fact. Superior ability breeds superior ambition. 
KIRK: Interesting, if true. They created a group of Alexanders, Napoleons. 
SPOCK: I have collected some names and made some counts. By my estimate, there were some eighty or ninety of these young supermen unaccounted for when they were finally defeated. 
KIRK: That fact isn't in the history texts. 
SPOCK: Would you reveal to war-weary populations that some eighty Napoleons might still be alive?

[Sickbay - medical ward]

(Khan is lounging, showing off his chest and calves.) 
MARLA: Ship's historian, Lieutenant 
KHAN: Marla McGivers. 
MARLA: Yes. 
KHAN: I am told you participated in my rebirth. 
MARLA: In a small way. 
KHAN: I've been reading up on starships, but they have one luxury not mentioned in the manuals. 
MARLA: I don't understand. 
KHAN: A beautiful woman. My name is Khan. Please sit and entertain me. 
(She perches on another bed) 
MARLA: I'd like some historical information about your ship, its purpose and 
KHAN: And why do you wear your hair in such an uncomplimentary fashion? 
MARLA: It's comfortable. 
KHAN: But it's not attractive. (He takes her to a mirror and loosens a couple of strands at the back.) There. Soft. Natural. Simple. 
MARLA: Mister Khan, I'm here on business. 
KHAN: You find no pleasure here? 
MARLA: My interest is scientific. Men of. That is, the world of the past. I'm sure you understand to actually talk to a man of your century 
KHAN: There. Simple, soft. Please remember. 
MARLA: Perhaps some other time, when you feel more like talking about the past. 
KHAN: I'm glad you came. Please do it again.

[Officer's Mess]

(The dining table is laid out, and the senior staff are in dress uniform.) 
MCCOY: Very impressive. Are we expecting a fleet admiral for dinner? 
KIRK: Lieutenant McGivers' idea to welcome Khan to our century. Just how strongly is she attracted to him? 
MCCOY: Well, there aren't any regulations against romance, Jim. 
KIRK: My curiosity's official, not personal, Bones. 
MCCOY: Well, he has a magnetism. Almost electric. You felt it. And it could over power McGivers with her preoccupation with the past.

[McGiver's quarters]

(A crewwoman shows Khan in.) 
KHAN: Thank you. I hoped you might guide me to our dinner engagement. (sees a picture on the wall) Very good. Fine technique. 
MARLA: It's a gladiator named Flavius. He once 
KHAN: And you've rearranged your hair for me. Excellent. 
KHAN: All bold men from the past. Richard, Leif Ericson, Napoleon. A hobby of yours, such men? 
(He uncovers a work in progress - a man in a turban) 
KHAN: I am honoured. Thank you. But I caution you. Such men dare take what they want. 
(He kisses her, and she responds.)

[Officer's mess]

(After dinner, as liqueurs are being served.) 
KIRK: Forgive my curiosity, Mister Khan, but my officers are anxious to know more about your extraordinary journey. 
SPOCK: And how you managed to keep it out of the history books. 
KHAN: Adventure, Captain. Adventure. There was little else left on Earth. 
SPOCK: There was the war to end tyranny. Many considered that a noble effort. 
KHAN: Tyranny, sir? Or an attempt to unify humanity? 
SPOCK: Unify, sir? Like a team of animals under one whip? 
KHAN: I know something of those years. Remember, it was a time of great dreams, of great aspiration. 
SPOCK: Under dozens of petty dictatorships. 
KHAN: One man would have ruled eventually. As Rome under Caesar. Think of its accomplishments. 
SPOCK: Then your sympathies were with 
KHAN: You are an excellent tactician, Captain. You let your second in command attack while you sit and watch for weakness. 
KIRK: You have a tendency to express ideas in military terms, Mister Khan. This is a social occasion. 
KHAN: It has been said that social occasions are only warfare concealed. Many prefer it more honest, more open. 
KIRK: You fled. Why? Were you afraid? 
KHAN: I've never been afraid. 
KIRK: But you left at the very time mankind needed courage. 
KHAN: We offered the world order! 
KIRK: We? 
KHAN: Excellent. Excellent. But if you will excuse me, gentlemen and ladies, I grow fatigued again. With your permission, Captain, I will return to my quarters. 
(Kirk stands, and Khan leaves.)

[Khan's quarters]

(Khan is pacing when Marla enters.) 
MARLA: I wanted to apologise. They had no right to treat you that way. 
KHAN: Quite understandable, since I'm something of a mystery to them. 
MARLA: You're no mystery to me. I know exactly who you are. 
KHAN: Do you? 
MARLA: Leif Ericson, Richard the Lion Heart, Napoleon. I don't know if you're going to like living in our time. 
KHAN: Then I'll have to remold it to my liking. 
(Embraces her)
MARLA: Please don't. 
(Pushes her away.) 
KHAN: Go. Or stay. But do it because it is what you wish to do. Well? 
MARLA: I'll stay a little longer. 
KHAN: How many minutes do you graciously offer? 
MARLA: I only meant 
KHAN: This grows tiresome. You must now ask to stay. 
MARLA: I'd like to stay. Please. 
(He takes her hand, then forces her down onto her knees.) 
KHAN: Open your heart. Will you open your heart? 
MARLA: Yes. 
KHAN: I intend to take this ship. Do you agree? 
MARLA: Oh, please don't ask me 
KHAN: I need your help. 
MARLA: You won't harm anyone? 
KHAN: Now you question me? 
MARLA: No. 
KHAN: Will you assist me? 
MARLA: Oh, please, Khan, don't ask me 
KHAN: Leave me then. Go, I say. 
MARLA: No. I promise. I'll do anything you ask.

[Briefing room]

(A large picture of their guest in on a screen) 
KIRK: Name, Khan, as we know him today. (Spock changes the picture) Name, Khan Noonien Singh. 
SPOCK: From 1992 through 1996, absolute ruler of more than a quarter of your world. From Asia through the Middle East. 
MCCOY: The last of the tyrants to be overthrown. 
SCOTT: I must confess, gentlemen. I've always held a sneaking admiration for this one. 
KIRK: He was the best of the tyrants and the most dangerous. They were supermen, in a sense. Stronger, braver, certainly more ambitious, more daring. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen, this romanticism about a ruthless dictator is 
KIRK: Mister Spock, we humans have a streak of barbarism in us. Appalling, but there, nevertheless. 
SCOTT: There were no massacres under his rule. 
SPOCK: And as little freedom. 
MCCOY: No wars until he was attacked. 
SPOCK: Gentlemen. 
KIRK: Mister Spock, you misunderstand us. We can be against him and admire him all at the same time. 
SPOCK: Illogical. 
KIRK: Totally. This is the Captain. Put a twenty four hour security on Mister Khan's quarters, effective immediately.

[Khan's quarters]

(Khan is seated at a plain table, dressed in a red Enterprise uniform shirt, when Kirk bursts in and sits opposite him.) 
KHAN: I'm sorry, Captain. I was lost in thought. My door. Locked from outside, a guard posted. 
KIRK: Unusual treatment for Khan Noonien Singh. 
KHAN: Excellent. You identified me with your computer system, I imagine. 
KIRK: I'd like those answers now. First, the purpose of your star flight. 
KHAN: A new life, a chance to build a world. Other things I doubt you would understand. 
KIRK: Why? Because I'm not a product of controlled genetics? 
KHAN: Captain, although your abilities intrigue me, you are quite honestly inferior. Mentally, physically. In fact, I am surprised how little improvement there has been in human evolution. Oh, there has been technical advancement, but, how little man himself has changed. Yes, it appears we will do well in your century, Captain. Do you have any other questions? 
KIRK: Thank you. They've all been answered. 
(He leaves, and the guard resumes his post. Khan summons his strength, wrenches the locked door open and knocks out his guard with a single blow.)

[Transporter room]

(Marla is holding a phaser on the transporter chief.) 
MARLA: Move away. 
(Khan comes in and incapacitates him with pressure at the base of the skull. She beams him to the Botany Bay.)

[SS Botany Bay]

(Freshly revived supermen and women are stretching their muscles when Khan greets them.)
KHAN: Otto. Joaquin. The trip is over. The battle begins again. Only this time it's not a world we win. It's a universe. Kati.

[Bridge]

SPINELLI: On course, sir. Warp factor two. 
KIRK: Maintain. (he answers the intercom) Bridge. 
SECURITY [OC]: Captain, Security here. Khan's escaped. 
KIRK: Sound security alert. 
UHURA: Security alert, Captain. Communication channels are down, Captain. 
(Kirk heads to the lift, but the doors do not open) 
SPOCK: Turbo elevators inoperative. Jammed, Captain. 
(Kirk rushes to a panel on the far bulkhead and pushes buttons.) 
KIRK: Atmospheric controls cut off. 
SPOCK: Useless. They're on override in Engineering. 
KIRK: Engineering. Scotty. This is the Bridge.

[Engineering]

SCOTT: Captain! 
(He gets knocked out)

[Bridge]

KIRK: What's going on down there?

[Engineering]

KHAN: He's not able to answer you at the moment, Captain.

[Bridge]

KHAN [OC]: Your ship is mine. I have shut off the life-support system to your Bridge, and jammed up your exit routes. I am willing to negotiate. 
KIRK: Flood all decks with neural gas. 
SPOCK: Impossible. Intruder control systems inoperative. Mister Khan was very thorough in his study of our tech manuals. 
KIRK: Contact Starbase Twelve. 
UHURA: All channels are totally jammed, Captain. 
SPOCK: Brilliant. Every contingency anticipated. 
KHAN [OC]: Your air should be getting quite thin by now.

[Engineering]

KHAN: Do you surrender the Bridge?

[Bridge]

KIRK: Negative.

[Engineering]

KHAN: Academic, Captain. Refuse,

[Bridge]

KHAN [OC]: And every person on the Bridge will suffocate. 
(A little later, with everyone else unconscious, Kirk makes his last log entry.) 
Stardate 3142.8. They have my ship, discarding their own worthless vessel. Only moments of air left on the Bridge now. Commendations recommended for Lieutenant Uhura, Technicians First Class Thule and Harrison, Lieutenant Spinelli and, of course, Mister Spock. I take full responsibility. I take full (He passes out)

[Briefing room]

(The senior staff are awake again, and listening to a speech at gunpoint.) 
KHAN: Nothing ever changes, except man. Your technical accomplishments? Improve a mechanical device and you may double productivity. But improve man and you gain a thousand fold. I am such a man. Join me. I'll treat you well. I need your training to operate a vessel this complex. 
SCOTT: Where is Captain Kirk? 
KHAN: I see now I made one serious error. You are the Communications Officer? Engage the viewing screen, please. 
(Uhura doesn't move, so Joaquin drags her to the table, then hits her. As he raises his hand again, Marla intervenes.) 
MARLA: No! 
KHAN: I should have realised that suffocating together on the Bridge would create heroic camaraderie among you. But it is quite a different thing to watch it happening to someone else. Engage the viewing screen. I'm sure you recognise your medical decompression chamber here, Doctor. And the meaning of that indicator. (It is dropping to 10Hg) Your Captain will die. If you join me, Mister Spock, I will save his life. My vessel was useless. I need you and yours to select a colony planet. One with a population willing to be led by us. 
MCCOY: To be conquered by you. A starship would make that most simple, wouldn't it? 
KHAN: Each of you in turn will go in there. Die while the others watch. 
MARLA: Khan. There's no reason I must watch this, is there? 
KHAN: (Shakes his head) But I hoped you would be stronger. (She leaves) If any one of you joins me, anyone! I'll let him live. It's so useless! 
JOACHIM: We've lost the channel. How do I regain picture? 
KHAN: It does not matter. The Captain is dead. Take Mister Spock next.

[Decompression chamber]

(There is one young man standing guard by the chamber door.) 
MARLA: Khan said to watch him very closely. He may decide to co-operate. 
(As he turns to look in the porthole, she injects him. He passes out and she repressurises the chamber, freeing Kirk.) 
MARLA: Captain, I saved your life. Now please don't kill him. 
(The outer Sickbay door opens, Kirk waits and then tackles Spock's guard. Spock neck-pinches him.) 
SPOCK: Surprised to see you, Captain, though pleased. 
KIRK: I'm a little pleased myself. Situation? 
SPOCK: Khan is holding our staff in the briefing room. His men have control of the ship. 
KIRK: Our only chance is the intruder control circuit. Although he's cut it off at the Bridge. 
SPOCK: There's a relay junction down the corridor. 
KIRK: Gas all decks but this one.

[Briefing room]

KHAN: Armoury, this is Khan. Report. Rodriguez. Ling. McPherson. Anyone. Report status. 
(Gas starts coming out of the ventilation grill. Khan flees, Scott hits a guard and gives chase. Everyone else coughs.)

[Corridor]

KIRK: Where's Khan? 
SCOTT: I don't know. He got out just as the gas 
KIRK: Kirk here. 
SPOCK [OC]: Anesthesia gas in all sections except Engineering. Someone just closed that line.

[Engineering]

(Khan is working controls and listening to the intercom messages.) 
SPOCK [OC]: Captain, acknowledge. Unable to flood Engineering section. I suspect 
SCOTT [OC]: This is Scott. Captain's headed for the Engineering section. I'll follow in case 
SPOCK [OC]: Negative. We must retake the vessel while the anesthesia lasts. Meet me in the Armoury. I'm blowing it clear first. Spock out. 
(Kirk dashes into Engineering and straight into Khan, who easily disarms him then crushes the phaser. Then an alarm beeps.) 
KHAN: If I understood your manuals, that's an overload in progress. Your ship flares up like an exploding sun within minutes. 
(The two fight. Khan can throw Kirk around with little effort.) 
KHAN: I have five times your strength. You're no match for me.
(But Kirk gets himself a weapon and clubs Khan into unconsciousness before stopping the overload and saving his ship.)

Captain's Log. Stardate 3143.3. Control of the Enterprise has been regained. I wish my next decisions were no more difficult. Khan and his people. What a waste to put them in a reorientation centre. And what do I do about McGivers?

[Briefing room]

(The senior staff are in dress uniform again.) 
UHURA: Record tapes engaged and ready, Captain. 
KIRK: This hearing is now in session. Under the authority vested in me by Starfleet Command, I declare all charges and specifications in this matter have been dropped. 
MCCOY: Jim. Agreed you have the authority 
KIRK: Mister Spock, our heading takes us near the Ceti Alpha star system. 
SPOCK: Quite correct, Captain. Planet number five there is habitable, although a bit savage, somewhat inhospitable. 
KIRK: But no more than Australia's Botany Bay colony was at the beginning. Those men went on to tame a continent, Mister Khan. Can you tame a world? 
KHAN: Have you ever read Milton, Captain? 
KIRK: Yes. I understand. Lieutenant Marla McGivers. Given a choice of court martial or accompanying them there. 
KHAN: (gazing into her eyes) It will be difficult. A struggle at first even to stay alive, to find food. 
MARLA: I'll go with him, sir. 
KHAN: A superior woman. I will take her. And I've gotten something else I wanted. A world to win, an empire to build. 
KIRK: This hearing is closed. 
(Khan and McGivers are escorted out.)
SCOTT: It's a shame for a good Scotsman to admit it, but I'm not up on Milton. 
KIRK: The statement Lucifer made when he fell into the pit. 'It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.' 
SPOCK: It would be interesting, Captain, to return to that world in a hundred years and to learn what crop has sprung from the seed you planted today. 
KIRK: Yes, Mister Spock, it would indeed
